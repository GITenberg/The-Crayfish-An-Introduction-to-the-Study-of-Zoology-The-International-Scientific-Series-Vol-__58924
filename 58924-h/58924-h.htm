<h2 class="h2herein">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In writing this book about Crayfishes it has not
been my intention to compose a zoological monograph
on that group of animals. Such a work, to
be worthy of the name, would require the devotion
of years of patient study to a mass of materials
collected from many parts of the world. Nor has
it been my ambition to write a treatise upon
our English crayfish, which should in any way provoke
comparison with the memorable labours of
Lyonet, Bojanus, or Strauss Durckheim, upon the
willow caterpillar, the tortoise, and the cockchafer.
What I have had in view is a much humbler, though
perhaps, in the present state of science, not less useful
object. I have desired, in fact, to show how
the careful study of one of the commonest and most
insignificant of animals, leads us, step by step, from
every-day knowledge to the widest
generalizations
and the most difficult problems of zoology; and,
indeed, of biological science in general.</p>

<p class="padtopb">It is for this reason that I have termed the book
an “Introduction to Zoology.” For, whoever will
follow its pages, crayfish in hand, and will try to
verify for himself the statements which it contains,
will find himself brought face to face with all the
great zoological questions which excite so lively an
interest at the present day; he will understand the
method by which alone we can hope to attain to
satisfactory answers of these questions; and, finally,
he will appreciate the justice of Diderot’s remark,
“Il faut être profond dans l’art ou dans la science
pour en bien posséder les éléments.”</p>

<p class="padtopb">And these benefits will accrue to the student
whatever shortcomings and errors in the work itself
may be made apparent by the process of verification.
“Common and lowly as most may think the crayfish,”
well says Roesel von Rosenhof, “it is yet so
full of wonders that the greatest naturalist may be
puzzled to give a clear account of it.”
But only
the broad facts of the case are of fundamental importance;
and, so far as these are concerned, I venture
to hope that no error has slipped into my
statement of them. As for the details, it must be
remembered, not only that some omission or mistake
is almost unavoidable, but that new lights
come with new methods of investigation; and that
better modes of statement follow upon the improvement
of our general views introduced by the gradual
widening of our knowledge.</p>

<p class="padtopb">I sincerely hope that such amplifications and
rectifications may speedily abound; and that this
sketch may be the means of directing the attention of
observers in all parts of the world to the crayfishes.
Combined efforts will soon furnish the answers to
many questions which a single worker can merely
state; and, by completing the history of one group
of animals, secure the foundation of the whole
of biological science.</p>

<p class="padtopb">In the Appendix, I have added a few notes respecting
points of detail with which I
thought it
unnecessary to burden the text; and, under the
head of Bibliography, I have given some references
to the literature of the subject which may be useful
to those who wish to follow it out more fully.</p>

<p class="padtopb">I am indebted to Mr. T. J. Parker, demonstrator
of my biological class, for several anatomical drawings;
and for valuable aid in supervising the
execution of the woodcuts, and in seeing the work
through the press.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Mr. Cooper has had charge of the illustrations,
and I am indebted to him and to Mr. Coombs,
the accurate and skilful draughtsman to whom
the more difficult subjects were entrusted, for
such excellent specimens of xylographic art as
the figures of the Crab, Lobster, Rock Lobster,
and Norway Lobster.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">M<b>ANY</b></span>
persons seem to believe that what is termed
Science is of a widely different nature from ordinary
knowledge, and that the methods by which scientific
truths are ascertained involve mental operations of a
recondite and mysterious nature, comprehensible only by
the initiated, and as distinct in their character as in
their subject matter, from the processes by which we
discriminate between fact and fancy in ordinary life.</p>

<p>But any one who looks into the matter attentively will
soon perceive that there is no solid foundation for the
belief that the realm of science is thus shut off from that
of common sense; or that the mode of investigation which
yields such wonderful results to the scientific investigator,
is different in kind from that
which is employed <span class="xxpn" id="p002">{2}</span>
for the commonest purposes of everyday existence.
Common sense is science exactly in so far as it fulfils
the ideal of common sense; that is, sees facts as they
are, or, at any rate, without the distortion of prejudice,
and reasons from them in accordance with the dictates
of sound judgment. And science is simply common sense
at its best; that is, rigidly accurate in observation, and
merciless to fallacy in logic.</p>

<p>Whoso will question the validity of the conclusions of
sound science, must be prepared to carry his scepticism
a long way; for it may be safely affirmed, that there is
hardly any of those decisions of common sense on
which men stake their all in practical life, which can
justify itself so thoroughly on common sense principles,
as the broad truths of science can be justified.</p>

<p>The conclusion drawn from due consideration of the
nature of the case is verified by historical inquiry; and
the historian of every science traces back its roots to the
primary stock of common information possessed by all
mankind.</p>

<p>In its earliest development knowledge is self-sown.
Impressions force themselves upon men’s senses whether
they will or not, and often against their will. The
amount of interest which these impressions awaken is
determined by the coarser pains and pleasures which
they carry in their train, or by mere curiosity; and
reason deals with the materials supplied to it as far as
that interest carries it, and no
farther. Such common <span class="xxpn" id="p003">{3}</span>
knowledge is rather brought than sought; and such
ratiocination is little more than the working of a blind
intellectual instinct.</p>

<p>It is only when the mind passes beyond this condition
that it begins to evolve science. When simple curiosity
passes into the love of knowledge as such, and the
gratification of the æsthetic sense of the beauty of completeness
and accuracy seems more desirable than the
easy indolence of ignorance; when the finding out of
the causes of things becomes a source of joy, and he
is counted happy who is successful in the search; common
knowledge of nature passes into what our forefathers
called Natural History, from whence there is but a step
to that which used to be termed Natural Philosophy, and
now passes by the name of Physical Science.</p>

<p>In this final stage of knowledge, the phenomena of
nature are regarded as one continuous series of causes
and effects; and the ultimate object of science is to trace
out that series, from the term which is nearest to us, to
that which is at the furthest limit accessible to our means
of investigation.</p>

<p>The course of nature as it is, as it has been, and as it
will be, is the object of scientific inquiry; whatever lies
beyond, above, or below this, is outside science. But
the philosopher need not despair at the limitation of his
field of labour: in relation to the human mind Nature is
boundless; and, though nowhere inaccessible, she is
everywhere unfathomable. <span class="xxpn" id="p004">{4}</span></p>

<p>The Biological Sciences embody the great multitude
of truths which have been ascertained respecting living
beings; and as there are two chief kinds of living things,
animals and plants, so Biology is, for convenience sake,
divided into two main branches, Zoology and Botany.</p>

<p>Each of these branches of Biology has passed through
the three stages of development, which are common to
all the sciences; and, at the present time, each is in these
different stages in different minds. Every country boy
possesses more or less information respecting the plants
and animals which come under his notice, in the stage
of common knowledge; a good many persons have
acquired more or less of that accurate, but necessarily
incomplete and unmethodised knowledge, which is understood
by Natural History; while a few have reached the
purely scientific stage, and, as Zoologists and Botanists,
strive towards the perfection of Biology as a branch of
Physical Science.</p>

<p>Historically, common knowledge is represented by the
allusions to animals and plants in ancient literature;
while Natural History, more or less grading into Biology,
meets us in the works of Aristotle, and his continuators
in the Middle Ages, Rondoletius, Aldrovandus, and their
contemporaries and successors. But the conscious attempt
to construct a complete science of Biology hardly
dates further back than Treviranus and Lamarck, at
the beginning of this century, while it has received its
strongest impulse, in our own
day, from Darwin. <span class="xxpn" id="p005">{5}</span></p>

<p>My purpose, in the present work, is to exemplify the
general truths respecting the development of zoological
science which have just been stated by the study of a
special case; and, to this end, I have selected an animal,
the Common Crayfish, which, taking it altogether, is
better fitted for my purpose than any other.</p>

<p>It is readily obtained,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn1"
id="fnanc1">1</a> and all the most important points of
its construction are easily deciphered; hence, those who
read what follows will have no difficulty in ascertaining
whether the statements correspond with facts or not. And
unless my readers are prepared to take this much trouble,
they may almost as well shut the book; for nothing is truer
than Harvey’s dictum, that those who read without acquiring
distinct images of the things about which they read, by the
help of their own senses, gather no real knowledge, but
conceive mere phantoms and idola.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc1"
id="fn1">1</a> If crayfish are not to be had, a lobster
will be found to answer to the description of the former,
in almost all points; but the gills and the abdominal
appendages present differences; and the last thoracic
somite is united with the rest in the lobster. (<i>See</i> Chap.
V.)</p></div>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>It is a matter of common information that a number of
our streams and rivulets harbour small animals, rarely
more than three or four inches long, which are very similar
to little lobsters, except that they are usually of a dull,
greenish or brownish colour, generally diversified with
pale yellow on the under side of the body, and sometimes
with red on the limbs. In
rare cases, their <span class="xxpn" id="p006">{6}</span>
general hue may be red or blue. These are “crayfishes,”
and they cannot possibly be mistaken for any
other inhabitants of our fresh waters.</p>

this and in succeeding figures the numbers of the somites
are given in Roman, those of the appendages in ordinary
numerals.</div></div>

<p>The animals may be seen walking along the bottom
of the shallow waters which they prefer, by means of four
pairs of jointed legs (fig.
<a href="#f01" title="go to &#x66;ig. 1">1</a>); but, if
alarmed, they swim <span class="xxpn" id="p007">{7}</span>
backwards with rapid jerks, propelled by the strokes of a
broad, fan-shaped flipper, which terminates the hinder
end of the body (fig.
<a href="#f01" title="go to &#x66;ig. 1">1</a>, <i>t</i>, <i>20</i>). In front of the four pairs
of legs, which are used in walking, there is a pair of
limbs of a much more massive character, each of which
ends in two claws disposed in such a manner as to
constitute a powerful pincer (fig.
<a href="#f01" title="go to &#x66;ig. 1">1</a>; <i>10</i>). These
claws are the chief weapons of offence and defence
of the crayfish, and those who handle them incautiously
will discover that their grip is by no means to be despised,
and indicates a good deal of disposable energy.
A sort of shield covers the front part of the body,
and ends in a sharp projecting spine in the middle
line (<i>r</i>). On each side of this is an eye, mounted on a
movable stalk (<i>1</i>), which can be turned in any direction:
behind the eyes follow two pairs of feelers; in one of
these, the feeler ends in two, short, jointed filaments (<i>2</i>);
while, in the other, it terminates in a single, many-jointed
filament, like a whip-lash, which is more than half the
length of the body (<i>3</i>). Sometimes turned backwards,
sometimes sweeping forwards, these long feelers continually
explore a considerable area around the body of
the crayfish.</p>

<p>If a number of crayfishes, of about the same size, are
compared together, it will easily be seen that they fall
into two sets; the jointed tail being much broader,
especially in the middle, in the one set than in the
other (fig.
<a href="#f02" title="go to &#x66;ig. 2">2</a>). The broad-tailed
crayfishes are the <span class="xxpn" id="p008">{8}</span>
females, the others the males. And the latter may
be still more easily known by the possession of four
curved styles, attached to the under face of the first
two rings of the tail, which are turned forwards between
the hinder legs, on the under side of the body (fig.
<a href="#f03" title="go to &#x66;ig. 3">3</a>, A;
<i>15</i>, <i>16</i>). In the female, there are mere soft filaments in
the place of the first pair of styles (fig.
<a href="#f03" title="go to &#x66;ig. 3">3</a>, B; <i>15</i>).</p>

<p>Crayfishes do not inhabit every British river, and even
where they are known to abound, it is not easy to find
them at all times of the year. In granite districts and
others, in which the soil yields little or no calcareous
matter to the waters which flow over it, crayfishes do
not occur. They are intolerant of great heat and of
much sunshine; they are therefore most active towards
the evening, while they shelter themselves under the
shade of stones and banks during the day. It has been
observed that they frequent those parts of a river which
run north and south, less than those which have an
easterly and westerly direction, inasmuch as the latter
yield more shade from the mid-day sun.</p>

<p>During the depth of winter, crayfishes are rarely to
be seen about in a stream; but they may be found
in abundance in its banks, in natural crevices and in
burrows which they dig for themselves. The burrows
may be from a few inches to more than a yard deep,
and it has been noticed that, if the waters are liable
to freeze, the burrows are deeper and further from
the surface than otherwise. Where
the soil, through <span class="xxpn" id="p009">{9}</span>
which a stream haunted by crayfishes runs, is soft
and peaty, the crayfishes work their way into it in all
directions, and thousands of them, of all sizes, may be
dug out, even at a considerable distance from the banks.</p>

<p>It does not appear that crayfishes fall into a state of
torpor in the winter, and thus “hybernate” in the strict
sense of the word. At any rate, so long as the weather
is open, the crayfish lies at the mouth of his burrow,
barring the entrance with his great claws, and with protruded
feelers keeps careful watch on the passers-by.
Larvæ of insects, water-snails, tadpoles, or frogs, which
come within reach, are suddenly seized and devoured,
and it is averred that the water-rat is liable to the same
fate. Passing too near the fatal den, possibly in search
of a stray crayfish, whose flavour he highly appreciates,
the vole is himself seized and held till he is suffocated,
when his captor easily reverses the conditions of the anticipated
meal.</p>

<p>In fact, few things in the way of food are amiss to
the crayfish; living or dead, fresh or carrion, animal or
vegetable, it is all one. Calcareous plants, such as the
stoneworts (<i>Chara</i>), are highly acceptable; so are any kinds
of succulent roots, such as carrots; and it is said that
crayfish sometimes make short excursions inland, in
search of vegetable food. Snails are devoured, shells
and all; the cast coats of other crayfish are turned to
account as supplies of needful calcareous matter; and
the unprotected or weakly member of
the family is <span class="xxpn" id="p010">{10}</span>
not spared. Crayfishes, in fact, are guilty of cannibalism
in its worst form; and a French observer pathetically
remarks, that, under certain circumstances,
the males “<i>méconnaissent les plus saints devoirs;</i>” and,
not content with mutilating or killing their spouses,
after the fashion of animals of higher moral pretensions,
they descend to the lowest depths of utilitarian turpitude,
and finish by eating them.</p>

<p>In the depth of winter, however, the most alert of
crayfish can find little enough food; and hence, when
they emerge from their hiding-places in the first warm
days of spring, usually about March, the crayfishes are in
poor condition.</p>

<p>At this time, the females are found to be laden with
eggs, of which from one to two hundred are attached beneath
the tail, and look like a mass of minute berries
(fig.
<a href="#f03" title="go to &#x66;ig. 3">3</a>, B). In May or June, these eggs are hatched, and
give rise to minute young, which are sometimes to be
found attached beneath the tail of the mother, under
whose protection they spend the first few days of their
existence.</p>

<p>In this country, we do not set much store upon crayfishes
as an article of food, but on the Continent, and
especially in France, they are in great request. Paris
alone, with its two millions of inhabitants, consumes
annually from five to six millions of crayfishes, and pays
about £16,000 for them. The natural productivity of the
rivers of France has long been inadequate
to supply the <span class="xxpn" id="p011">{11}</span>
demand for these delicacies; and hence, not only are large
quantities imported from Germany, and elsewhere, but
the artificial cultivation of crayfish has been successfully
attempted on a considerable scale.</p>

<p>Crayfishes are caught in various ways; sometimes the
fisherman simply wades in the water and drags them out
of their burrows; more commonly, hoop-nets baited with
frogs are let down into the water and rapidly drawn up,
when there is reason to think that crayfish have been
attracted to the bait; or fires are lighted on the banks at
night, and the crayfish, which are attracted, like moths,
to the unwonted illumination, are scooped out with the
hand or with nets.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Thus far, our information respecting the crayfish is
such as would be forced upon anyone who dealt in crayfishes,
or lived in a district in which they were commonly
used for food. It is common knowledge. Let us now
try to push our acquaintance with what is to be learned
about the animal a little further, so as to be able to give
an account of its Natural History, such as might have
been furnished by Buffon if he had dealt with the subject.</p>

<p>There is an inquiry which does not strictly lie
within the province of physical science, and yet suggests
itself naturally enough at the outset of a natural history.</p>

<p>The animal we are considering has two names,
one common, <i>Crayfish</i>, the other technical, <i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>.
How has it come by these two
names, and why, <span class="xxpn" id="p012">{12}</span>
having a common English name for it already, should
naturalists call it by another appellation derived from a
foreign tongue?</p>

<p>The origin of the common name, “crayfish,” involves
some curious questions of etymology, and indeed, of history.
It might readily be supposed that the word “cray”
had a meaning of its own, and qualified the substantive
“fish”—as “jelly” and “cod” in “jellyfish” and “codfish.”
But this certainly is not the case. The old English
method of writing the word was “crevis” or “crevice,”
and the “cray” is simply a phonetic spelling of the syllable
“cre,” in which the “e” was formerly pronounced
as all the world, except ourselves, now pronounce that
vowel. While “fish” is the “vis” insensibly modified
to suit our knowledge of the thing as an aquatic
animal.</p>

<p>Now “crevis” is clearly one of two things. Either it
is a modification of the French name “écrevisse,” or of
the Low Dutch name “crevik,” by which the crayfish is
known in these languages. The former derivation is that
usually given, and, if it be correct, we must refer “crayfish”
to the same category as “mutton,” “beef,” and
“pork,” all of which are French equivalents, introduced
by the Normans, for the “sheep’s flesh,” “ox flesh,” and
“swine’s flesh,” of their English subjects. In this case,
we should not have called a crayfish, a crayfish, except
for the Norman conquest.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if “crevik” is the
source of our <span class="xxpn" id="p013">{13}</span>
word, it may have come to us straight from the Angle
and Saxon contingent of our mixed ancestry.</p>

<p>As to the origin of the technical name; ἀστακός, <i>astakos</i>,
was the name by which the Greeks knew the lobster; and
it has been handed down to us in the works of Aristotle,
who does not seem to have taken any special notice of the
crayfish. At the revival of learning, the early naturalists
noted the close general similarity between the lobster and
the crayfish; but, as the latter lives in fresh water, while
the former is a marine animal, they called the crayfish,
in their Latin, <i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>, or the “river-lobster,”
by way of distinction; and this nomenclature was retained
until, about forty-five years ago, an eminent
French Naturalist, M. Milne-Edwards, pointed out that
there are far more extensive differences between lobsters
and crayfish than had been supposed; and that it would
be advisable to mark the distinctness of the things by
a corresponding difference in their names. Leaving
<i>Astacus</i> for the crayfishes, he proposed to change the
technical name of the lobster into <i>Homarus</i>, by latinising
the old French name “<i>Omar</i>,” or “<i>Homar</i>” (now
<i>Homard</i>), for that animal.</p>

<p>At the present time, therefore, while the recognised
technical name of the crayfish is <i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>, that of
the lobster is <i>Homarus vulgaris</i>. And as this nomenclature
is generally received, it is desirable that it should not
be altered; though it is attended by the inconvenience,
that <i>Astacus</i>, as we now employ the
name, does not <span class="xxpn" id="p014">{14}</span>
denote that which the Greeks, ancient and modern,
signify, by its original, <i>astakos</i>; and does signify
something quite different.</p>

<p>Finally, as to why it is needful to have two names
for the same thing, one vernacular, and one technical.
Many people imagine that scientific terminology is a
needless burden imposed upon the novice, and ask us
why we cannot be content with plain English. In reply,
I would suggest to such an objector to open a conversation
about his own business with a carpenter, or an engineer,
or, still better, with a sailor, and try how far plain
English will go. The interview will not have lasted long
before he will find himself lost in a maze of unintelligible
technicalities. Every calling has its technical terminology;
and every artisan uses terms of art, which sound
like gibberish to those who know nothing of the art, but
are exceedingly convenient to those who practise it.</p>

<p>In fact, every art is full of conceptions which are
special to itself; and, as the use of language is to convey
our conceptions to one another, language must supply
signs for those conceptions. There are two ways of
doing this: either existing signs may be combined in
loose and cumbrous periphrases; or new signs, having
a well-understood and definite signification, may be invented.
The practice of sensible people shows the
advantage of the latter course; and here, as elsewhere,
science has simply followed and improved upon common
sense. <span class="xxpn" id="p015">{15}</span></p>

<p>Moreover, while English, French, German, and Italian
artisans are under no particular necessity to discuss
the processes and results of their business with one
another, science is cosmopolitan, and the difficulties of
the study of Zoology would be prodigiously increased, if
Zoologists of different nationalities used different technical
terms for the same thing. They need a universal
language; and it has been found convenient that the language
shall be the Latin in form, and Latin or Greek in
origin. What in English is Crayfish, is <i>Écrevisse</i> in
French; <i>Flusskrebs</i>, in German; <i>Cammaro</i>, or <i>Gambaro</i>,
or <i>Gammarello</i>, in Italian: but the Zoologist of each
nationality knows that, in the scientific works of all the
rest, he shall find what he wants to read under the head
of <i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>.</p>

<p>But granting the expediency of a technical name for
the Crayfish, why should that name be double? The
reply is still, practical convenience. If there are ten
children of one family, we do not call them all Smith,
because such a procedure would not help us to distinguish
one from the other; nor do we call them
simply John, James, Peter, William, and so on, for
that would not help us to identify them as of one family.
So we give them all two names, one indicating their
close relation, and the other their separate individuality—as
John Smith, James Smith, Peter Smith, William
Smith, &amp;c. The same thing is done in Zoology; only,
in accordance with the genius of
the Latin language, <span class="xxpn" id="p016">{16}</span>
we put the Christian name, so to speak, after the surname.</p>

<p>There are a number of kinds of Crayfish, so similar
to one another that they bear the common surname of
<i>Astacus</i>. One kind, by way of distinction, is called
<i>fluviatile</i>, another <i>slender-handed</i>, another <i>Dauric</i>, from
the region in which it lives; and these double names are
rendered by—<i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>, <i>Astacus leptodactylus</i>,
and <i>Astacus dauricus</i>; and thus we have a nomenclature
which is exceedingly simple in principle, and free from
confusion in practice. And I may add that, the less
attention is paid to the original meaning of the substantive
and adjective terms of this binomial nomenclature,
and the sooner they are used as proper names,
the better. Very good reasons for using a term may
exist when it is first invented, which lose their validity
with the progress of knowledge. Thus <i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>
was a significant name so long as we knew of only one
kind of crayfish; but now that we are acquainted with a
number of kinds, all of which inhabit rivers, it is meaningless.
Nevertheless, as changing it would involve endless
confusion, and the object of nomenclature is simply to
have a definite name for a definite thing, nobody dreams
of proposing to alter it.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Having learned this much about the origin of the
names of the crayfish, we may next proceed to consider
those points which an observant Naturalist,
who did not <span class="xxpn" id="p017">{17}</span>
care to go far beyond the surface of things, would find to
notice in the animal itself.</p>

<p>Probably the most conspicuous peculiarity of the crayfish,
to any one who is familiar only with the higher
animals, is the fact that the hard parts of the body are
outside and the soft parts inside; whereas in ourselves,
and in the ordinary domestic animals, the hard parts, or
bones, which constitute the skeleton, are inside, and the
soft parts clothe them. Hence, while our hard framework
is said to be an <i>endoskeleton</i>, or internal skeleton; that
of the crayfish is termed an <i>exoskeleton</i>, or external
skeleton. It is from the circumstance that the body of
the crayfishes is enveloped in this hard crust, that
the name of <i>Crustacea</i> is applied to them, along with
the crabs, shrimps, and other such animals. Insects,
spiders, and centipedes have also a hard exoskeleton,
but it is usually not so hard and thick as in the
<i>Crustacea</i>.</p>

<p>If a piece of the crayfish’s skeleton is placed in strong
vinegar, abundant bubbles of carbonic acid gas are given
off from it, and it rapidly becomes converted into a soft
laminated membrane, while the solution will be found to
contain lime. In fact the exoskeleton is composed of
a peculiar animal matter, so much impregnated with
carbonate and phosphate of lime that it becomes dense
and hard.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the body of the crayfish is
naturally marked out into several
distinct regions. There <span class="xxpn" id="p019">{19}</span>
is a firm and solid front part, covered by a large continuous
shield, which is called the <i>carapace</i>; and a jointed
hind part, commonly termed the tail (fig.
<a href="#f02" title="go to &#x66;ig. 2">2</a>). From
the perception of a partially real, and partially fanciful,
analogy with the regions into which the body is divided
in the higher animals, the fore part is termed the <i>cephalo-thorax</i>,
or head (<i>cephalon</i>) and chest (<i>thorax</i>) combined,
while the hinder part receives the name of
<i>abdomen</i>.</p>

<p>Now the exoskeleton is not of the same constitution
throughout these regions. The abdomen, for example,
is composed of six complete hard rings (fig.
<a href="#f02" title="go to &#x66;ig. 2">2</a>, <span
class="smmaj">XV–XX</span>), and a terminal flap, on the
under side of which the vent (fig.
<a href="#f03" title="go to &#x66;ig. 3">3</a>, <i>a</i>) is situated,
and which is called the <i>telson</i> (fig.
<a href="#f02" title="go to &#x66;ig. 2">2</a>, <i>t,&#xa0;t′</i>). All
these are freely moveable upon one another, inasmuch as
the exoskeleton which connects them is not calcified, but
is, for the most part, soft and flexible, like the hard
exoskeleton when the lime salts have been removed by acid.
The mechanism of the joints will have to be attentively
considered by-and-by; it is sufficient, at present, to
remark that, wherever a joint, exists, it is produced in
the same fashion, by the exoskeleton remaining soft in
certain regions of the jointed part.</p>

<p>The carapace is not jointed; but a transverse groove is
observed about the middle of it, the ends of which run
down on the sides and then turn forwards (figs.
<a href="#f01" title="go to &#x66;ig. 1">1</a> and
<a href="#f02" title="go to &#x66;ig. 2">2</a>,
<i>cg</i>). This is called the <i>cervical groove</i>, and
it marks off <span class="xxpn" id="p020">{20}</span>
the region of the head, in front, from that of the thorax
behind.</p>

<p>The thorax seems at first not to be jointed at all; but
if its under, or what is better called its <i>sternal</i>, surface is
examined carefully, it will be found to be divided into as
many transverse bands, or segments, as there are pairs of
legs (fig.
<a href="#f03" title="go to &#x66;ig. 3">3</a>); and, moreover, the hindermost of these
segments is not firmly united with the rest, but can be
moved backwards and forwards through a small space
(fig.
<a href="#f03" title="go to &#x66;ig. 3">3</a>, B; xiv).</p>

<p>Attached to the sternal side of every ring of the abdomen
of the female there is a pair of limbs, called <i>swimmerets</i>.
In the five anterior rings, these are small and slender
(fig.
<a href="#f03" title="go to &#x66;ig. 3">3</a>, B; <i>15, 19</i>); but those of the sixth ring are very
large, and each ends in two broad plates (<i>20</i>). These
two plates on each side, with the telson in the middle,
constitute the flapper of the crayfish, by the aid of which
it executes its retrograde swimming movements. The
small swimmerets move together with a regular swing,
like paddles, and probably aid in propelling the animal
forwards. In the breeding female (B), the eggs are
attached to them; while, in the male, the two anterior
pairs (A; <i>15, 16</i>) are converted into the peculiar styles
which distinguish that sex.</p>

<p>The four pairs of legs which are employed for walking
purposes, are divided into a number of joints, and the
foremost two pairs are terminated by double claws,
arranged so as to form a pincer, whence they
are said to <span class="xxpn" id="p022">{22}</span>
be <i>chelate</i>. The two hindermost pairs, on the other
hand, end in simple claws.</p>

<p>In front of these legs, come the great prehensile
limbs (<i>10</i>), which are chelate, like those which immediately
follow them, but vastly larger. They often
receive the special name of <i>chelæ</i>; and the large terminal
joints are called the “hand.” We shall escape confusion
if we call these limbs the <i>forceps</i>, and restrict the name
of <i>chela</i> to the two terminal joints.</p>

<p>All the limbs hitherto mentioned subserve locomotion
and prehension in various degrees. The crayfish swims
by the help of its abdomen, and the hinder pairs of abdominal
limbs; walks by means of the four hinder pairs
of thoracic limbs; lays hold of anything to fix itself, or
to assist in climbing, by the two chelate anterior pairs of
these limbs, which are also employed in tearing the food
seized by the forceps and conveying it to the mouth;
while it seizes its prey and defends itself with the forceps.
The part which each of these limbs plays is termed its
<i>function</i> and it is said to be the <i>organ</i> of that function;
so that all these limbs may be said to be organs of the
functions of locomotion, of offence and defence.</p>

<p>In front of the forceps, there is a pair of limbs which
have a different character, and take a different direction
from any of the foregoing (<i>9</i>). These limbs, in fact, are
turned directly forwards, parallel with one another, and
with the middle line of the body. They are divided into
a number of joints, of which one of those
near the base <span class="xxpn" id="p023">{23}</span>
is longer than the rest, and strongly toothed along the
inner edge, or that which is turned towards its fellow.
It is obvious that these two limbs are well adapted to
crush and tear whatever comes between them, and they
are, in fact, <i>jaws</i> or organs of manducation. At the same
time, it will be noticed that they retain a curiously close
general resemblance to the hinder thoracic legs; and
hence, for distinction’s sake, they are called outer <i>foot-jaws</i>
or external <i>maxillipedes</i>.</p>

<p>If the head of a stout pin is pushed between these
external maxillipedes, it will be found that it passes
without any difficulty into the interior of the body,
through the mouth. In fact, the mouth is relatively
rather a large aperture; but it cannot be seen without
forcing aside, not only these external foot-jaws, but a
number of other limbs, which subserve the same function
of manducation, or chewing and crushing the food. We
may pass by the organs of manducation, for the present,
with the remark that there are altogether three pairs of
maxillipedes, followed by two pairs of somewhat differently
formed <i>maxillæ</i>, and one pair of very stout and strong
jaws, which are termed the <i>mandibles</i> (<i>4</i>). All these jaws
work from side to side, in contradistinction to the jaws
of vertebrated animals, which move up and down. In
front of, and above the mouth, with the jaws which
cover it, are seen the long feelers, which are called the
<i>antennæ</i> (<i>3</i>); above, and in front of them, follow the
small feelers, or <i>antennules</i> (<i>2</i>); and over
them, again, lie <span class="xxpn" id="p024">{24}</span>
the <i>eye stalks</i> (<i>1</i>). The antennæ are organs of touch;
the antennules, in addition, contain the organs of hearing;
while, at the ends of the eyestalks, are the organs
of vision.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the crayfish has a jointed and
segmented body, the rings of which it is composed being
very obvious in the abdomen, but more obscurely traceable
elsewhere; that it has no fewer than twenty pairs
of what may be called by the general name of <i>appendages</i>;
and that these appendages are turned to
different uses, or are organs of different functions, in
different parts of the body. The crayfish is obviously
a very complicated piece of living machinery. But we
have not yet come to the end of all the organs that may
be discovered even by cursory inspection. Every one
who has eaten a boiled crayfish, or a lobster, knows
that the great shield, or carapace, is very easily separated
from the thorax and abdomen, the head and the limbs
which belong to that region coming away with the
carapace. The reason of this is not far to seek. The
lower edges of that part of the carapace which belongs to
the thorax approach the bases of the legs pretty closely,
but a cleft-like space is left; and this cleft extends
forwards to the sides of the region of the mouth, and
backwards and upwards, between the hinder margin of
the carapace and the sides of the first ring of the abdomen,
which are partly overlapped by, and partly overlap,
that margin. If the blade of a pair
of scissors is <span class="xxpn" id="p025">{25}</span>
carefully introduced into the cleft from behind, as high up
as it will go without tearing anything, and a cut is then
made, parallel with the middle line, as far as the cervical
groove, and thence following the cervical groove to the
base of the outer foot-jaws, a large flap will be removed.
This flap of the carapace is called the <i>branchiostegite</i>
(fig.
<a href="#f01" title="go to &#x66;ig. 1">1</a>, <i>bg</i>), because it covers the gills or <i>branchiæ</i>
(fig.
<a href="#f04" title="go to &#x66;ig. 4">4</a>), which are now exposed. They have the appearance
of a number of delicate plumes, which take a direction
from the bases of the legs upwards and forwards
behind, upwards and backwards in front, their summits
converging towards the upper end of the cavity in which
they are placed, and which is called the <i>branchial
chamber</i>. These branchiæ are the respiratory organs;
and they perform the same functions as the gills of a
fish, to which they present some similarity.</p>

<p>If the gills are cleared away, it is seen that the branchial
cavity is bounded, on the inner side, by a sloping wall,
formed by a delicate, but more or less calcified layer of
the exoskeleton, which constitutes the proper outer wall
of the thorax. At the upper limit of the branchial cavity,
the layer of exoskeleton is very thin, and turning outwards,
is continued into the inner wall or lining of the
branchiostegite, which is also very thin (<i>see</i>
fig. <a href="#f15" title="go to &#x66;ig. 15">15</a>, p. 70).</p>

<p>Thus the branchial chamber is altogether outside the
body, to which it stands in somewhat the same relation
as the space between the flaps of a man’s coat and his
waistcoat would do to the part of the body
enclosed by the <span class="xxpn" id="p027">{27}</span>
waistcoat, if we suppose the lining of the flaps to be made
in one piece with the sides of the waistcoat. Or a closer
parallel still would be brought about, if the skin of a
man’s back were loose enough to be pulled out, on each
side, into two broad flaps covering the flanks.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the branchial chamber is open
behind, below, and in front; and, therefore, that the water
in which the crayfish habitually lives has free ingress
and egress. Thus the air dissolved in the water enables
breathing to go on, just as it does in fishes. As is the
case with many fishes, the crayfish breathes very well
out of the water, if kept in a situation sufficiently cool
and moist to prevent the gills from drying up; and
thus there is no reason why, in cool and damp weather,
the crayfish should not be able to live very well on land,
at any rate among moist herbage, though whether
our common crayfishes do make such terrestrial excursions
is perhaps doubtful. We shall see, by-and-by, that
there are some exotic crayfish which habitually live on
land, and perish if they are long submerged in water.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>With respect to the internal structure of the crayfish,
there are some points which cannot escape notice, however
rough the process of examination may be.</p>

<div class="dctr07" id="f05">

<p>Thus, when the carapace is removed in a crayfish
which has been just killed, the heart is seen still
pulsating. It is an organ of considerable relative size
(fig.
<a href="#f05" title="go to &#x66;ig. 5">5</a>, <i>h</i>), which is situated
immediately beneath the <span class="xxpn" id="p029">{29}</span>
middle region of that part of the carapace which lies
behind the cervical groove; or, in other words, in the
dorsal region of the thorax. In front of it, and therefore
in the head, is a large rounded sac, the stomach (fig.
<a href="#f05" title="go to &#x66;ig. 5">5</a>,
<i>cs</i>; fig.
<a href="#f06" title="go to &#x66;ig. 6">6</a>, <i>cs</i>, <i>ps</i>), from which a very delicate intestine
(figs. <a href="#f05" title="go to &#x66;ig. 5">5</a> and
<a href="#f06" title="go to &#x66;ig. 6">6</a>, <i>hg</i>) passes straight back through the thorax
and abdomen to the vent (fig.
<a href="#f06" title="go to &#x66;ig. 6">6</a>, <i>a</i>).</p>

<p>In summer, there are commonly to be found at the sides
of the stomach two lenticular calcareous masses, which
are known as “crabs’-eyes,” or <i>gastroliths</i>, and were, in
old times, valued in medicine as sovereign remedies for all
sorts of disorders. These bodies (fig.
<a href="#f07" title="go to &#x66;ig. 7">7</a>) are smooth and
flattened, or concave, on the side which
is turned towards <span class="xxpn" id="p030">{30}</span>
the cavity of the stomach; while the opposite side, being
convex and rough with irregular prominences, is something
like a “brain-stone” coral.</p>

gastrolith; A, from above; B, from below; C, from one side
(all ×&#x202f;5); D, in vertical section (×&#x202f;20).</div></div>

<p>Moreover, when the stomach is laid open, three large
reddish teeth are seen to project conspicuously into its
interior (fig.
<a href="#f06" title="go to &#x66;ig. 6">6</a>, <i>lt</i>, <i>mt</i>); so that, in addition to its six
pairs of jaws, the crayfish has a supplementary crushing
mill in its stomach. On each side of the stomach, there
is a soft yellow or brown mass, commonly
known as the <span class="xxpn" id="p031">{31}</span>
liver (fig.
<a href="#f05" title="go to &#x66;ig. 5">5</a>, <i>Lr</i>); and, in the breeding season, the
ovaries of the females, or organs in which the eggs are
formed, are very conspicuous from the dark-coloured
eggs which they contain, and which, like the exoskeleton,
turn red when they are boiled. The corresponding part
in a cooked lobster goes by the name of the “coral.”</p>

<p>Beside these internal structures, the most noticeable
are the large masses of flesh, or muscle, in the thorax
and abdomen, and in the pincers; which, instead of
being red, as in most of the higher animals, is white.
It will further be observed that the blood, which flows
readily when a crayfish is wounded, is a clear fluid, and
is either almost colourless, or of a very pale reddish or
neutral tint. Hence the older Naturalists thought that
the crayfish was devoid of blood, and had merely a sort
of ichor in place of it. But the fluid in question is true
blood; and if it is received into a vessel, it soon forms a
soft, but firm, gelatinous clot.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The crayfish grows rapidly in youth, but enlarges more
and more slowly as age advances. The young animal which
has just left the egg is of a greyish colour, and about
one quarter of an inch long. By the end of the year, it
may have reached nearly an inch and a half in length.
Crayfishes of a year old are, on an average, two inches
long; at two years, two inches and four-fifths; at three
years, three inches and a half; at four years, four inches
and a half nearly; and at five years,
five inches. They <span class="xxpn" id="p032">{32}</span>
go on growing till, in exceptional cases, they may attain
between seven inches and eight inches in length; but at
what degree of longevity this unusual dimension is reached
is uncertain. It seems probable, however, that the life of
these animals may be prolonged to as much as fifteen or
twenty years. They appear to reach maturity, so far as
the power of reproduction is concerned, in their fifth or,
more usually, their sixth year. However, I have seen
a female, with eggs attached under the abdomen, only
two inches long, and therefore, probably, in her second
year. The males are commonly larger than females of
the same age.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The hard skeleton of a crayfish, once formed, is
incapable of being stretched, nor can it increase by interstitial
addition to its substance, as the bone of one
of the higher animals grows. Hence it follows, that the
enlargement of the body, which actually takes place,
involves the shedding and reproduction of its investment.
This might be effected by insensible degrees, and
in different parts of the body at different times, as we
shed our hair; but, as a matter of fact, it occurs periodically
and universally, somewhat as the feathers of birds
are moulted. The whole of the old coat of the body is
thrown off at once, and suddenly; and the new coat,
which has, in the meanwhile, been formed beneath
the old one, remains soft for a time, and allows of a
rapid increase in the dimensions of the
body before it <span class="xxpn" id="p033">{33}</span>
hardens. This sort of moulting is what is technically
termed <i>ecdysis</i>, or <i>exuviation</i>. It is commonly spoken of
as the “shedding of the skin,” and there is no harm in
using this phrase, if we recollect that the shed coat is not
the skin, in the proper sense of the word, but only what
is termed a <i>cuticular layer</i>, which is secreted upon the
outer surface of the true integument. The cuticular
skeleton of the crayfish, in fact, is not even so much a
part of the skin as the cast of a snake, or as our own nails.
For these are composed of coherent, formed parts of the
epidermis; while the hard investment of the crayfish contains
no such formed parts, and is developed on the outside
of those structures which answer to the constituents
of the epidermis in the higher animals. Thus the crayfish
grows, as it were, by starts; its dimensions remaining
stationary in the intervals of its moults, and then rapidly
increasing for a few days, while the new exoskeleton is
in the course of formation.</p>

<p>The ecdysis of the crayfish was first thoroughly
studied a century and a half ago, by one of the most
accurate observers who ever lived, the famous Réaumur,
and the following account of this very curious process is
given nearly in his words.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn2" id="fnanc2">2</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc2" id="fn2">2</a>
See Réaumur’s two Memoirs, “Sur les diverses reproductions qui
se font dans les écrevisses, les omars, les crabes, etc.,” “Histoire de
l’Académie royale des Sciences,” année 1712; and “Additions aux observations
sur la mue des écrevisses données dans les Mémoires de 1712.”
Ibid. 1718.</p></div>

<p>A few hours before the process of
exuviation <span class="xxpn" id="p034">{34}</span>
commences, the crayfish rubs its limbs one against the
other, and, without changing its place, moves each
separately, throws itself on its back, bends its tail,
and then stretches it out again, at the same time vibrating
its antennæ. By these movements, it gives the
various parts a little play in their loosened sheaths.
After these preparatory steps, the crayfish appears to
become distended; in all probability, in consequence of
the commencing retraction of the limbs into the interior
of the exoskeleton of the body. In fact, it has been
remarked, that if, at this period, the extremity of one of
the great claws is broken off, it will be found empty,
the contained soft parts being retracted as far as the
second joint. The soft membranous part of the exoskeleton,
which connects the hinder end of the carapace
with the first ring of the abdomen, gives way, and the
body, covered with the new soft integument, protrudes;
its dark brown colour rendering it easily distinguishable
from the greenish-brown old integument.</p>

<p>Having got thus far, the crayfish rests for a while, and
then the agitation of the limbs and body recommences.
The carapace is forced upwards and forwards by the protrusion
of the body, and remains attached only in the
region of the mouth. The head is next drawn backwards,
while the eyes and its other appendages are extracted from
their old investment. Next the legs are pulled out, either
one at a time, or those of one, or both, sides together.
Sometimes a limb gives way and is left behind
in its sheath. <span class="xxpn" id="p035">{35}</span>
The operation is facilitated by the splitting of the old
integument of the limb along one side longitudinally.</p>

<p>When the legs are disengaged, the animal draws its
head and limbs completely out of their former covering;
and, with a sudden spring forward, while it extends its
abdomen, it extracts the latter, and leaves its old skeleton
behind. The carapace falls back into its ordinary
position, and the longitudinal fissures of the sheaths of
the limbs close up so accurately, that the shed integument
has just the appearance the animal had when the
exuviation commenced. The cast exoskeleton is so like
the crayfish itself, when the latter is at rest, that, except
for the brighter colour of the latter, the two cannot be
distinguished.</p>

<p>After exuviation, the owner of the cast skin, exhausted
by its violent struggles, which are not unfrequently
fatal, lies in a prostrate condition. Instead of
being covered by a hard shell, its integument is soft and
flabby, like wet paper; though Réaumur remarks, that
if a crayfish is handled immediately after exuviation, its
body feels hard; and he ascribes this to the violent contraction
which its muscles have undergone, leaving them
in a state of cramp. In the absence of the hard skeleton,
however, there is nothing to bring the contracted muscles
at once back into position, and it must be some time
before the pressure of the internal fluids is so distributed
as to stretch them out.</p>

<p>When the process of exuviation has
proceeded so far <span class="xxpn" id="p036">{36}</span>
that the carapace is raised, nothing stops the crayfish
from continuing its struggles. If taken out of the water
in this condition, they go on moulting in the hand, and
even pressure on their bodies will not arrest their efforts.</p>

<p>The length of time occupied from the first giving way
of the integuments to the final emergence of the animal,
varies with its vigour, and the conditions under which it
is placed, from ten minutes to several hours. The
chitinous lining of the stomach, with its teeth, and the
“crabs’-eyes,” are shed along with the rest of the cuticular
exoskeleton; but they are broken up and dissolved
in the stomach.</p>

<p>The new integuments of the crayfish remain soft for
a period which varies from one to three days; and it is
a curious fact, that the animal appears to be quite aware
of its helplessness, and governs itself accordingly.</p>

<p>An observant naturalist says: “I once had a domesticated
crayfish (<i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>), which I kept in
a glass pan, in water, not more than an inch and a half
deep, previous experiment having shown that in deeper
water, probably from want of sufficient aëration, this
animal would not live long. By degrees my prisoner
became very bold, and when I held my fingers at the
edge of the vessel, he assailed them with promptness and
energy. About a year after I had him, I perceived, as I
thought, a second crayfish with him. On examination,
I found it to be his old coat, which he had left in a most
perfect state. My friend had now lost
his heroism, and <span class="xxpn" id="p037">{37}</span>
fluttered about in the greatest agitation. He was quite
soft; and every time I entered the room during the next
two days, he exhibited the wildest terror. On the third,
he appeared to gain confidence, and ventured to use his
nippers, though with some timidity, and he was not yet
quite so hard as he had been. In about a week, however,
he became bolder than ever; his weapons were
sharper, and he appeared stronger, and a nip from him
was no joke. He lived in all about two years, during
which time his food was a very few worms at very uncertain
times; perhaps he did not get fifty altogether.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn3" id="fnanc3">3</a></p>

<p>It would appear, from the best observations that have
yet been made, that the young crayfish exuviate two or
three times in the course of the first year; and that,
afterwards, the process is annual, and takes place usually
about midsummer. There is reason to suppose that very
old crayfish do not exuviate every year.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>It has been stated that, in the course of its violent
efforts to extract its limbs from the cast-off exoskeleton,
the crayfish sometimes loses one or other of them; the
limb giving way, and the greater part, or the whole, of it
remaining in the exuviæ. But it is not only in this way
that crayfishes part with their limbs. At all times, if the
animal is held by one of its pincers, so that it cannot
get away, it is apt to solve the difficulty
by casting off <span class="xxpn" id="p038">{38}</span>
the limb, which remains in the hand of the captor, while
the crayfish escapes. This voluntary amputation is always
effected at the same place; namely, where the limb is
slenderest, just beyond the articulation which unites the
basal joint with the next. The other limbs also readily
part at the joints; and it is very common to meet with
crayfish which have undergone such mutilation. But
the injury thus inflicted is not permanent, as these
animals possess the power of reproducing lost parts to
a marvellous extent, whether the loss has been inflicted
by artificial amputation, or voluntarily.</p>

<p>Crayfishes, like all the <i>Crustacea</i>, bleed very freely when
wounded; and if one of the large joints of a leg is cut
through, or if the animal’s body is injured, it is very likely
to die rapidly from the ensuing hæmorrhage. A crayfish
thus wounded, however, commonly throws off the
limb at the next articulation, where the cavity of the
limb is less patent, and its sides more readily fall
together; and, as we have seen, the pincers are usually
cast off at their narrowest point. When such amputation
has taken place, a crust, probably formed of coagulated
blood, rapidly forms over the surface of the stump; and,
eventually, it becomes covered with a cuticle. Beneath
this, after a time, a sort of bud grows out from the
centre of the surface of the stump, and gradually takes
on the form of as much of the limb as has been removed.
At the next ecdysis, the covering cuticle is thrown off
along with the rest of the
exoskeleton; while the <span class="xxpn" id="p039">{39}</span>
rudimentary limb straightens out, and, though very small,
acquires all the organization appropriate to that limb.
At every moult it grows; but, it is only after a long time
that it acquires nearly the size of its uninjured and older
fellow. Hence, it not unfrequently happens, that crayfish
are found with pincers and other limbs, which, though
alike useful and anatomically complete, are very unequal
in size.</p>

<p>Injuries inflicted while the crayfish are soft after
moulting, are apt to produce abnormal growths of the
part affected; and these may be perpetuated, and give
rise to various monstrosities, in the pincers and in other
parts of the body.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In the reproduction of their kind by means of eggs the
co-operation of the males with the females is necessary.
On the basal joint of the hindermost pair of legs of the male
a small aperture is to be seen (fig.
<a href="#f03" title="go to &#x66;ig. 3">3</a>, A; <i>vd</i>). In these, the
ducts of the apparatus in which the fecundating substance
is formed terminate. The fecundating material itself is a
thickish fluid, which sets into a white solid after extrusion.
The male deposits this substance on the thorax
of the female, between the bases of the hindermost pairs
of thoracic limbs.</p>

<p>The eggs formed in the ovary are conducted to apertures,
which are situated on the bases of the last pair of ambulatory
legs but two, that is, in the hinder of the two pair
which are provided with chelate extremities (fig.
<a href="#f03" title="go to &#x66;ig. 3">3</a>, B; <i>od</i>). <span class="xxpn" id="p040">{40}</span></p>

<p>After the female has received the deposit of the
spermatic matter of the male, she retires to a burrow,
in the manner already stated, and then the process of
laying the eggs commences. These, as they leave the
apertures of the oviducts, are coated with a viscid matter,
which is readily drawn out into a short thread. The
end of the thread attaches itself to one of the long hairs,
with which the swimmerets are fringed, and as the viscid
matter rapidly hardens, the egg thus becomes attached
to the limb by a stalk. The operation is repeated, until
sometimes a couple of hundred eggs are thus glued on
to the swimmerets. Partaking in the movements of the
swimmerets, they are washed backwards and forwards in
the water, and thus aërated and kept free of impurities;
while the young crayfish is formed much in the same
way as the chick is formed in a hen’s egg.</p>

<p>The process of development, however, is very slow,
as it occupies the whole winter. In late spring-time, or
early summer, the young burst the thin shell of the
egg, and, when they are hatched, present a general resemblance
to their parents. This is very unlike what
takes place in crabs and lobsters, in which the young
leave the egg in a condition very different from the
parent, and undergo a remarkable metamorphosis before
they attain their proper form.</p>

<p>For some time after they are hatched, the young hold
on to the swimmerets of the mother, and are carried
about, protected by her abdomen, as in a
kind of nursery. <span class="xxpn" id="p041">{41}</span></p>

<p>That most careful naturalist, Roesel von Rosenhof,
says of the young, when just hatched:—</p>

<p>“At this time they are quite transparent; and when
such a crayfish [a female with young] is brought to
table, it looks quite disgusting to those who
do not know <span class="xxpn" id="p042">{42}</span>
what the young are; but if we examine it more closely,
especially with a magnifying-glass, we see with pleasure
that the little crayfish are already perfect, and resemble
the large one in all respects. When the mother of these
little crayfish, after they have begun to be active, is quiet
for a while, they leave her and creep about, a short way
off. But, if they spy the least sign of danger, or there is
any unusual movement in the water, it seems as if the
mother recalled them by a signal; for they all at once
swiftly return under her tail, and gather into a cluster,
and the mother hies to a place of safety with them, as
quickly as she can. A few days later, however, they
gradually forsake her.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn4" id="fnanc4">4</a></p>

<p>Fishermen declare that “Hen Lobsters” protect their
young in a similar manner.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn5" id="fnanc5">5</a>
Jonston,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn6" id="fnanc6">6</a>
who wrote in
the middle of the seventeenth century, says that the little
crayfish are often to be seen adhering to the tail of the
mother. Roesel’s observations imply the same thing;
but he does not describe the exact mode of adherence,
and I can find no observations on the subject in the
works of later writers.</p>

<p>It has been seen that the eggs are attached to the
swimmerets by a viscid substance, which is, as it were,
smeared over them and the hairs with
which they are <span class="xxpn" id="p043">{43}</span>
fringed, and is continued by longer or shorter thread-like
pedicles into the coat of the same material which invests
each egg. It very soon hardens, and then becomes very
firm and elastic.</p>

<p>When the young crayfish is ready to be hatched, the egg
case splits into two moieties, which remain attached, like a
pair of watch glasses, to the free end of the pedicle of the
egg (fig.
<a href="#f08" title="go to &#x66;ig. 8">8</a>, A; <i>ec</i>). The young animal, though very similar
to the parent, does not quite “resemble it in all respects,”
as Roesel says. For not only are the first and the last
pairs of abdominal limbs wanting, while the telson is very
different from that of the adult; but the ends of the great
chelæ are sharply pointed and bent down into abruptly incurved
hooks, which overlap when the chelæ are shut (fig.
<a href="#f08" title="go to &#x66;ig. 8">8</a>,
B). Hence, when the chelæ have closed upon anything soft
enough to allow of the imbedding of these hooks, it is
very difficult, if not impossible, to open them again.</p>

<p>Immediately the young are set free, they must instinctively
bury the ends of their forceps in the hardened
egg-glue which is smeared over the swimmerets, for they
are all found to be holding on in this manner. They
exhibit very little movement, and they bear rough
shaking or handling without becoming detached; in
consequence, I suppose, of the interlocking of the hooked
ends of the chelæ imbedded in the egg-glue.</p>

<p>Even after the female has been plunged into alcohol,
the young remain attached. I have had a female, with
young affixed in this manner, under
observation for five <span class="xxpn" id="p044">{44}</span>
days, but none of them showed any signs of detaching
themselves; and I am inclined to think that they are
set free only at the first moult. After this, it would
appear that the adhesion to the parent is only temporary.</p>

<p>The walking legs are also hooked at their extremities,
but they play a less important part in fixing the young
to the parent, and seem to be always capable of loosing
their hold.</p>

<p>I find the young of a Mexican crayfish (<i>Cambarus</i>) to be
attached in the same manner as those of the English
crayfish; but, according to Mr. Wood-Mason’s recent
observations, the young of the New Zealand crayfishes
fix themselves to the swimmerets of the parent by the
hooked ends of their hinder ambulatory limbs.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Crayfishes, in every respect similar to those found
in our English rivers, that is to say, of the species
<i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>, are met with in Ireland, and on the
Continent, as far south as Italy and northern Greece;
as far east as western Russia; and as far north as the
shores of the Baltic. They are not known to occur in
Scotland; in Spain, except about Barcelona, they are
either rare, or have remained unnoticed.</p>

<p>There is, at present, no proof of the occurrence of
<i>Astacus fluviatilis</i> in the fossil state.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Curious myths have gathered about crayfishes, as
about other animals. At one
time “crabs’-eyes” were <span class="xxpn" id="p045">{45}</span>
collected in vast numbers, and sold for medicinal
purposes as a remedy against the stone, among other
diseases. Their real utility, inasmuch as they consist
almost entirely of carbonate of lime, with a little phosphate
of lime and animal matter, is much the same as
that of chalk, or carbonate of magnesia. It was, formerly,
a current belief that crayfishes grow poor at the
time of new moon, and fat at that of full moon; and,
perhaps, there may be some foundation for the notion,
considering the nocturnal habits of the animals. Van
Helmont, a great dealer in wonders, is responsible for
the story that, in Brandenburg, where there is a great
abundance of crayfishes, the dealers were obliged to
transport them to market by night, lest a pig should
run under the cart. For if such a misfortune should
happen, every crayfish would be found dead in the
morning: “Tam exitialis est porcus cancro.” Another
author improves the story, by declaring that the steam
of a pig-stye, or of a herd of swine, is instantaneously
fatal to crayfish. On the other hand, the smell of
putrifying crayfish, which is undoubtedly of the strongest,
was said to drive even moles out
of their burrows.</p></div><!--section-->

<span class="hsmall">THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE CRAY­FISH. THE
MECH­A­NISM BY WHICH THE PARTS OF THE LIV­ING EN­GINE ARE
SUP­PLIED WITH THE MA­TER­I­ALS NEC­ES­SARY FOR THEIR MAIN­TE­NANCE
AND GROWTH.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">An analysis of such a sketch of the
“Natural History of the Crayfish” as is given in the
preceding chapter, shows that it provides brief and general
answers to three questions. First, what is the form and
structure of the animal, not only when adult, but at
different stages of its growth? Secondly, what are the
various actions of which it is capable? Thirdly, where is
it found? If we carry our investigations further, in such a
manner as to give the fullest attainable answers to these
questions, the knowledge thus acquired, in the case of the
first question, is termed the <i>Morphology</i> of the crayfish;
in the case of the second question, it constitutes the
<i>Physiology</i> of the animal; while the answer to the third
question would represent what we know of its <i>Distribution</i>
or <i>Chorology</i>. There remains a fourth problem, which can
hardly be regarded as seriously under discussion, so long
as knowledge has advanced no further than the Natural
History stage; the question, namely, <span class="xxpn"
id="p047">{47}</span> how all these facts comprised under
Morphology, Physiology, and Chorology have come to be what
they are; and the attempt to solve this problem leads us
to the crown of Biological effort, <i>Ætiology</i>. When it
supplies answers to all the questions which fall under
these four heads, the Zoology of Crayfish will have said
its last word.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>As it matters little in what order we take the first three
questions, in expanding Natural History into Zoology,
we may as well follow that which accords with the history
of science. After men acquired a rough and general
knowledge of the animals about them, the next thing which
engaged their interest was the discovery in these animals
of arrangements by which results, of a kind similar to
those which their own ingenuity effects through mechanical
contrivances, are brought about. They observed that
animals perform various actions; and, when they looked
into the disposition and the powers of the parts by which
these actions are performed, they found that these parts
presented the characters of an apparatus, or piece of
mechanism, the action of which could be deduced from
the properties and connections of its constituents, just
as the striking of a clock can be deduced from the
properties and connections of its weights and wheels.</p>

<p>Under one aspect, the result of the search after the
<i>rationale</i> of animal structure thus set afoot is <i>Teleology</i>;
or the doctrine of adaptation to
purpose. Under another <span class="xxpn" id="p048">{48}</span>
aspect, it is <i>Physiology</i>; so far as Physiology consists in
the elucidation of complex vital phenomena by deduction
from the established truths of Physics and Chemistry, or
from the elementary properties of living matter.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>We have seen that the crayfish is a voracious and
indiscriminate feeder; and we shall be safe in assuming
that, if duly supplied with nourishment, a full-grown
crayfish will consume several times its own weight of
food in the course of the year. Nevertheless, the increase
of the animal’s weight at the end of that time is, at most,
a small fraction of its total weight; whence it is quite
clear, that a very large proportion of the food taken into
the body must, in some shape or other, leave it again.
In the course of the same period, the crayfish absorbs a
very considerable quantity of oxygen, supplied by the
atmosphere to the water which it inhabits; while it gives
out, into that water, a large amount of carbonic acid, and
a larger or smaller quantity of nitrogenous and other excrementitious
matters. From this point of view, the
crayfish may be regarded as a kind of chemical manufactory,
supplied with certain alimentary raw materials,
which it works up, transforms, and gives out in other
shapes. And the first physiological problem which offers
itself to us is the mode of operation of the apparatus
contained in this factory, and the extent to which the
products of its activity are to be accounted for by
reasoning from known physical
and chemical principles. <span class="xxpn" id="p049">{49}</span></p>

<p>We have learned that the food of the crayfish is made
up of very diverse substances, both animal and vegetable;
but, so far as they are competent to nourish the animal
permanently, these matters all agree in containing a
peculiar nitrogenous body, termed <i>protein</i>, under one of its
many forms, such as albumen, fibrin, and the like. With
this may be associated fatty matters, starchy and saccharine
bodies, and various earthy salts. And these,
which are the essential constituents of the food, may be,
and usually are, largely mixed up with other substances,
such as wood, in the case of vegetable food, or skeletal
and fibrous parts, in the case of animal prey, which are
of little or no utility to the crayfish.</p>

<p>The first step in the process of feeding, therefore, is
to reduce the food to such a state, that the separation
of its nutritive parts, or those which can be turned to
account, from its innutritious, or useless, constituents,
may be facilitated. And this preliminary operation is
the subdivision of the food into morsels of a convenient
size for introduction into that part of the machinery in
which the extraction of the useful products is performed.</p>

<p>The food may be seized by the pincers, or by the
anterior chelate ambulatory limbs; and, in the former
case, it is usually, if not always, transferred to the first,
or second, or both of the anterior pairs of ambulatory
limbs. These grasp the food, and, tearing it into
pieces of the proper dimensions, thrust them between
the external maxillipedes, which are, at
the same time, <span class="xxpn" id="p050">{50}</span>
worked rapidly to and fro sideways, so as to bring their
toothed edges to bear upon the morsel. The other five
pairs of jaws are no less active, and they thus crush and
divide the food brought to them, as it is passed between
their toothed edges to the opening of the mouth.</p>

<p>As the alimentary canal stretches from the mouth,
at one end, to the vent at the other, and, at each of
these limits, is continuous with the wall of the body,
we may conceive the whole crayfish to be a hollow
cylinder, the cavity of which is everywhere closed, though
it is traversed by a tube, open at each end (fig.
<a href="#f06" title="go to &#x66;ig. 6">6</a>).
The shut cavity between the tube and the walls of the
cylinder may be termed the <i>perivisceral cavity</i>; and it is
so much filled up by the various organs, which are interposed
between the alimentary canal and the body wall,
that all that is left of it is represented by a system of
irregular channels, which are filled with blood, and are
termed <i>blood sinuses</i>. The wall of the cylinder is the
outer wall of the body itself, to which the general name
of <i>integument</i> may be given; and the outermost layer of
this, again, is the <i>cuticle</i>, which gives rise to the whole
of the exoskeleton. This cuticle, as we have seen, is
extensively impregnated with lime salts; and, moreover,
in consequence of its containing <i>chitin</i>, it is often spoken
of as the <i>chitinous cuticula</i>.</p>

<p>Having arrived at this general conception of the disposition
of the parts of the factory, we may next proceed
to consider the machinery of
alimentation which is <span class="xxpn" id="p051">{51}</span>
contained within it, and which is represented by the various
divisions of the alimentary canal, with its appendages;
by the apparatus for the distribution of nutriment; and
by two apparatuses for getting rid of those products
which are the ultimate result of the working of the whole
organism.</p>

<p>And here we must trench somewhat upon the province
of <i>Morphology</i>, as some of these pieces of apparatus are
complicated; and their action cannot be comprehended
without a certain knowledge of their anatomy.</p>

<p>The mouth of the crayfish is a longitudinally elongated,
parallel-sided opening, in the integument of the ventral
or sternal aspect of the head. Just outside its lateral
boundaries, the strong mandibles project, one on each
side (fig 3, B; <i>4</i>); their broad crushing surfaces, which
are turned towards one another, are therefore completely
external to the oral cavity. In front, the mouth is overlapped
by a wide shield-shaped plate termed the upper
lip, or <i>labrum</i> (figs.
<a href="#f03" title="go to &#x66;ig. 3">3</a> and
<a href="#f06" title="go to &#x66;ig. 6">6</a>, <i>lb</i>); while, immediately behind
the mandibles, there is, on each side, an elongated
fleshy lobe, joined with its fellow by the posterior
boundary of the mouth. These together constitute the
<i>metastoma</i> (fig.
<a href="#f03" title="go to &#x66;ig. 3">3</a>, B; <i>mt</i>), which is sometimes called
the lower lip. A short wide gullet, termed the œsophagus
(fig.
<a href="#f06" title="go to &#x66;ig. 6">6</a>, <i>oe</i>), leads directly upwards into a spacious
bag, the <i>stomach</i>, which occupies almost the whole cavity
of the head. It is divided by a constriction into a large
anterior chamber (<i>cs</i>), into the under face
of which the <span class="xxpn" id="p052">{52}</span>
gullet opens, and a small posterior chamber (<i>ps</i>), from
which the intestine (<i>hg</i>) proceeds.</p>

<p>In a man’s stomach, the opening by which the gullet
communicates with the stomach is called the <i>cardia</i>,
while that which places the stomach in communication
with the intestine is named the <i>pylorus</i>; and these terms
having been transferred from human anatomy to that of
the lower animals, the larger moiety of the crayfish’s
stomach is called the <i>cardiac division</i>, while the smaller
is termed the <i>pyloric division</i> of the organ. It must be
recollected, however, that, in the crayfish, the so-called
cardiac division is that which is actually furthest from
the heart, not that which is nearest to it, as in man.</p>

<p>The gullet is lined by a firm coat which resembles thin
parchment. At the margins of the mouth, this strong
lining is easily seen to be continuous with the cuticular
exoskeleton; while, at the cardiac orifice, it spreads out
and forms the inner or cuticular wall of the whole gastric
cavity, as far as the pylorus, where it ends in certain
valvular projections. The chitinous cuticle which forms
the outermost layer of the integument is thus, as it were,
turned in, to constitute the innermost layer of the walls
of the stomach; and it confers upon them so great an
amount of stiffness that they do not collapse when the
organ is removed from the body. Furthermore, just as
the cuticle of the integument is calcified to form the hard
parts of the exoskeleton, so is the cuticle of the stomach
calcified, or otherwise hardened, to give rise,
in the first <span class="xxpn" id="p053">{53}</span>
place, to the very remarkable and complicated apparatus
which has already been spoken of, as a sort of <i>gastric mill</i>
or <i>food-crusher</i>; and, secondly, to a <i>filter</i> or <i>strainer</i>,
whereby the nutritive juices are separated from the innutritious
hard parts of the food and passed on into the
intestine.</p>

<p>The gastric mill begins in the hinder half of the cardiac
division. Here, on the upper wall of the stomach, we see
a broad transverse calcified bar (figs.
<a href="#f09" title="go to &#x66;ig. 9">9</a>–11, <i>c</i>) from
the middle of the hinder part of which another bar (<i>uc</i>),
united to the first by a flexible portion, is continued
backwards in the middle line. The whole has, therefore,
somewhat the shape of a cross-bow. Behind the first-mentioned
piece, the dorsal wall of the stomach is folded
in, in such a manner as to give rise to a kind of pouch;
and the second piece, or what we may call the handle of
the crossbow, lies in the front wall of this pouch. The
end of this piece is dense and hard, and its free surface,
which looks into the top of the cardiac chamber, is
raised into two oval, flattened convex surfaces (<i>t</i>). Connected
by a transverse joint with the end of the handle
of the crossbow, there is another solid bar, which ascends
obliquely forwards in the back wall of the pouch (<i>pp</i>).
The end which is articulated with the handle of the crossbow
is produced into a strong reddish conical tooth (<i>mt</i>),
curved forwards and bifurcated at the summit; consequently,
when the cavity of the stomach is inspected from
the fore part of the cardiac pouch (fig.
<a href="#f09" title="go to &#x66;ig. 9">9</a>, B), the two-pointed
curved tooth (<i>mt</i>) is seen projecting behind the
convex surfaces (<i>t</i>), in the middle line, into the interior
of that cavity. The joint which connects the handle of the
crossbow with the hinder middle piece is elastic; hence,
if the two are straightened out, they return to their bent disposition
as soon as they are released. The
upper end of <span class="xxpn" id="p055">{55}</span>
the hinder middle piece (<i>pp</i>) is connected with a second flat
transverse plate which lies in the dorsal wall of the pyloric
chamber (<i>p</i>). The whole arrangement, thus far, may be
therefore compared to a large cross-bow and a small one,
with the ends of their handles fastened together by a
spring joint, in such a manner that the handle of the
one makes an acute angle with the handle of the other;
while the middle of each bow is united with the middle of
the other by the bent arm formed by the two handles.
But, in addition to this, the outer ends of the two bows
are also connected together. A small, curved, calcified
bar (<i>pc</i>) passes from the outer end of the front crosspiece
downwards and outwards in the wall of the stomach, and
its hinder and lower extremity is articulated with another
larger bar (<i>zc</i>) which runs upwards and backwards to
the hinder or pyloric crosspiece, with which it articulates.
Internally, this piece projects into the cardiac cavity of
the stomach as a stout elongated reddish elevation (<i>lt</i>),
the surface of which is produced into a row of strong
sharp, transverse ridges, which diminish in size from
before backwards, and constitute a crushing surface
almost like that of the grinder of an elephant. Thus,
when the front part of the cardiac cavity is cut away,
not only are the median teeth already mentioned seen,
but, on each side of them, there is one of these long
lateral teeth.</p>

<p>There are two small pointed teeth, one under each
of the lateral teeth, and each of these
is supported by <span class="xxpn" id="p056">{56}</span>
a broad plate, hairy on its inner surface, which enters
into the lateral wall of the cardiac chamber. There are
various other smaller skeletal parts, but the most important
are those which have been described; and these,
from what has been said, will be seen to form a sort of
hexagonal frame, with more or less flexible joints at the
angles, and having the anterior and
the posterior sides <span class="xxpn" id="p057">{57}</span>
connected by a bent jointed middle bar. As all these
parts are merely modifications of the hard skeleton, the
apparatus is devoid of any power of moving itself. It
is set in motion, however, by the same substance as that
which gives rise to all the other bodily movements of
the crayfish, namely, <i>muscle</i>. The chief muscles which
move it are four very strong bundles of fibres. Two of
these are attached to the front crosspiece, and proceed
thence, upwards and forwards, to be fixed to the inner face
of the carapace in the front part of the head (figs.
<a href="#f05" title="go to &#x66;ig. 5">5</a>,
<a href="#f06" title="go to &#x66;ig. 6">6</a>,
and <a href="#f12" title="go to &#x66;ig. 12">12</a>, <i>ag</i>). The two others, which are fixed into the
hinder crosspiece and hinder lateral pieces, pass upwards
and backwards, to be attached to the inner face of the
carapace in the back part of the head (<i>pg</i>). When these
muscles shorten, or contract, they pull the front and back
crosspieces further away from one another; consequently,
the angle between the handles becomes more open and
the tooth which is borne on their ends travels downwards
and forwards. But, at the same time, the angle between
the side bars becomes more open and the lateral tooth
of each side moves inwards till it crosses in front of the
middle tooth, and strikes against this and the opposite
lateral tooth, which has undergone a corresponding change
of place. The muscles being now relaxed, the elasticity
of the joints suffices to bring the whole apparatus back
to its first position, when a new contraction brings about
a new clashing of the teeth. Thus, by the alternate contraction
and relaxation of these two pair
of muscles, the <span class="xxpn" id="p058">{58}</span>
three teeth are made to stir up and crush whatever is
contained in the cardiac chamber. When the stomach is
removed and the front part of the cardiac chamber is cut
away, the front cross-piece may be seized with one pair
of forceps and the hind cross-piece with another. On
slightly pulling the two, so as to imitate the action of the
muscles, the three teeth will be found to come together
sharply, exactly in the manner described.</p>

<p>Works on mechanics are full of contrivances for the
conversion of motion; but it would, perhaps, be difficult to
discover among these a prettier solution of the problem;
given a straight pull, how to convert it into three simultaneous
convergent movements of as many points.</p>

<p>What I have called the <i>filter</i> is constructed mainly out
of the chitinous lining of the pyloric chamber. The aperture
of communication between this and the cardiac
chamber, already narrow, on account of the constriction of
the walls of the stomach at this point, is bounded at the
sides by two folds; while, from below, a conical tongue-shaped
process (figs.
<a href="#f06" title="go to &#x66;ig. 6">6</a>,
<a href="#f10" title="go to &#x66;ig. 10">10</a>, and
<a href="#f11" title="go to &#x66;ig. 11">11</a>, <i>cpv</i>), the surface of
which is covered with hairs, further obstructs the opening.
In the posterior half of the pyloric chamber, its side walls
are, as it were, pushed in; and, above, they so nearly meet
in the middle line, that a mere vertical chink is left between
them; while even this is crossed by hairs set upon
the two surfaces. In its lower half, however, each side
wall curves outwards, and forms a cushion-shaped surface
(fig.
<a href="#f10" title="go to &#x66;ig. 10">10</a>, <i>cs</i>) which looks downwards and
inwards. If the <span class="xxpn" id="p059">{59}</span>
floor of the pyloric chamber were flat, a wide triangular
passage would thus be left open in its lower half. But,
in fact, the floor rises into a ridge in the middle, while, at
the sides, it adapts itself to the shape of the two cushion-shaped
surfaces; the result of which is that the whole
cavity of the posterior part of the pyloric division of the
stomach is reduced to a narrow three-rayed fissure. In
transverse section, the vertical ray of this fissure is
straight, while the two lateral ones are concave upwards
(fig.
<a href="#f09" title="go to &#x66;ig. 9">9</a>, <i>E</i>). The cushions of the side walls are covered
with short close-set hairs. The corresponding surfaces
of the floor are raised into longitudinal parallel ridges,
the edge of each of which is fringed with very fine hairs.
As everything which passes from the cardiac sac to the
intestine must traverse this singular apparatus, only the
most finely divided solid matters can escape stoppage, so
long as its walls are kept together.</p>

<p>Finally, at the opening of the pyloric sac into the
intestine, the chitinous investment terminates in five
symmetrically arranged processes, the disposition of
which is such that they must play the part of valves
in preventing any sudden return of the contents of the
intestine to the stomach, while they readily allow
of a passage the other way. One of these valvular
processes is placed in the middle line above (figs.
<a href="#f10" title="go to &#x66;ig. 10">10</a> and
<a href="#f11" title="go to &#x66;ig. 11">11</a>, <i>v</i><sup>1</sup>). It is longer than the
others and concave below. The lateral processes
(<i>v</i><sup>2</sup>,) of which there are two on each
side, are triangular and flat. <span class="xxpn"

<p>The cuticular lining which gives rise to all the complicated
apparatus which has just been described, must
not be confounded with the proper wall of the stomach,
which invests it, and to which it owes it origin, just as
the cuticle of the integument is produced
by the soft <span class="xxpn" id="p061">{61}</span>
true skin which lies beneath it. The wall of the stomach
is a soft pale membrane containing variously disposed
muscular fibres; and, beyond the pylorus, it is continued
into the wall of the intestine.</p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that the intestine is
a slender and thin-walled tube, which passes straight
through the body almost without change, except that it
becomes a little wider and thicker-walled near the vent.
Immediately behind the pyloric valves, its surface is quite
smooth and soft (figs.
<a href="#f09" title="go to &#x66;ig. 9">9</a>,
<a href="#f10" title="go to &#x66;ig. 10">10</a>, and
<a href="#f12" title="go to &#x66;ig. 12">12</a>, <i>mg</i>), and its floor
presents a relatively large aperture, the termination of
the bile duct (fig.
<a href="#f12" title="go to &#x66;ig. 12">12</a>, <i>bd</i>, fig.
<a href="#f10" title="go to &#x66;ig. 10">10</a>, <i>hp</i>), on each side. The
roof is, as it were, pushed out into a short median pouch
or <i>cæcum</i> (<i>cæ</i>). Behind this, its character suddenly
changes, and six squarish elevations, covered with a
chitinous cuticle, encircle the cavity of the intestine (<i>r</i>).
From each of these, a longitudinal ridge, corresponding
with a fold of the wall of the intestine, takes its rise, and
passes, with a slight spiral twist, to its extremity (<i>hg</i>).
Each of these ridges is beset with small papillæ, and the
chitinous lining is continued over the whole to the vent,
where it passes into the general cuticle of the integument,
just as the lining of the stomach is continuous
with the cuticle of the integument at the mouth. The
alimentary canal may, therefore, be distinguished into
a <i>fore</i> and a <i>hind-gut</i> (<i>hg</i>), which have a thick internal
lining of cuticular membrane; and a very short <i>mid-gut</i>
(<i>mg</i>), which has no thick cuticular layer. It
will be of <span class="xxpn" id="p063">{63}</span>
importance to recollect this distinction by-and-by, when
the development of the alimentary canal is considered.</p>

<p>If the treatment to which the food is subjected in
the alimentary apparatus were of a purely mechanical
nature, there would be nothing more to describe in this
part of the crayfish’s mechanism. But, in order that
the nutritive matters may be turned to account, and
undergo the chemical metamorphoses, which eventually
change them into substances of a totally different character,
they must pass out of the alimentary canal into
the blood. And they can do this only by making their
way through the walls of the alimentary canal; to which
end they must either be in a state of extremely fine
division, or they must be reduced to the fluid condition.
In the case of the fatty matters, minute subdivision may
suffice; but the amylaceous substances and the insoluble
protein compounds, such as the fibrin of flesh, must be
brought into a state of solution. Therefore some substances
must be poured into the alimentary canal, which,
when mixed with the crushed food, will play the part
of a chemical agent, dissolving out the insoluble proteids,
changing the amyloids into soluble sugar, and converting
all the proteids into those diffusible forms of protein
matter, which are known as <i>peptones</i>.</p>

<p>The details of the processes here indicated, which
may be included under the general name of <i>digestion</i>, have
only quite recently been carefully investigated in the
crayfish; and we have probably still much
to learn about <span class="xxpn" id="p064">{64}</span>
them; but what has been made out is very interesting,
and proves that considerable differences exist between
crayfishes and the higher animals in this respect.</p>

<p>The physiologist calls those organs, the function of
which is to prepare and discharge substances of a special
character, <i>glands</i>; and the matter which they elaborate
is termed their <i>secretion</i>. On the one side, glands are
in relation with the blood, whence they derive the
materials which they convert into the substances
characteristic of their secretion; on the other side,
they have access, directly or indirectly, to a free surface,
on to which they pour their secretion as it is formed.</p>

<p>Of such glands, the alimentary canal of the crayfish
is provided with a pair, which are not only of very large
size, but are further extremely conspicuous, on account
of their yellow or brown colour. These two glands (figs.
<a href="#f12" title="go to &#x66;ig. 12">12</a> and
<a href="#f13" title="go to &#x66;ig. 13">13</a>, <i>lr</i>) are situated beneath, and on each side of, the
stomach and the anterior part of the intestine, and answer
in position to the glands termed liver and pancreas in the
higher animals, inasmuch as they pour their secretion into
the mid-gut. These glands have hitherto always been regarded
as the <i>liver</i>, and the name may be retained, though
their secretion appears rather to correspond with the
pancreatic fluid than with the bile of the higher animals.</p>

stomach, the line pointing to the pyloric ossicle;
<i>r</i>, ridge separating mid-gut from hind-gut; <i>zc</i>,
zygocardiac ossicle.</div></div>

<p>Each liver consists of an immense number of short
tubes, or <i>cæca</i>, which are closed at one end, but open at
the other into a general conduit, which is termed their
<i>duct</i>. The mass of the liver is
roughly divided into <span class="xxpn" id="p066">{66}</span>
three lobes, one anterior, one lateral, and one posterior;
and each lobe has its main duct, into which all the tubes
composing it open. The three ducts unite together into
a wide common duct (<i>bd</i>), which opens, just behind the pyloric
valves, into the floor of the mid-gut. Hence the apertures
of the two <i>hepatic ducts</i> are seen, one on each side,
in this part of the alimentary canal when it is laid open
from above. Every cæcum of the liver has a thin outer
wall, lined internally by a layer of cells, constituting what
is termed an <i>epithelium</i>; and, at the openings of the
hepatic ducts, this epithelium passes into a layer of somewhat
similar structure, which lines the mid-gut, and is
continued through the rest of the alimentary canal,
beneath the cuticula. Hence the liver may be regarded
as a much divided side pouch of the mid-gut.</p>

<p>The epithelium is made up of <i>nucleated cells</i>, which are
particles of simple living matter, or <i>protoplasm</i>, in the
midst of each of which is a rounded body, which is termed
the <i>nucleus</i>. It is these cells which are the seat of the
manufacturing process which results in the formation of
the secretion; it is, as it were, their special business to
form that secretion. To this end they are constantly being
newly formed at the summits of the cæca. As they grow,
they pass down towards the duct and, at the same time,
separate into their interior certain special products,
among which globules of yellow fatty matter are very
conspicuous. When these products are fully formed, what
remains of the substance of the cells
dissolves away, and <span class="xxpn" id="p067">{67}</span>
the yellow fluid accumulating in the ducts passes into
the mid-gut. The yellow colour is due to the globules of
fat. In the young cells, at the summit of the cæca,
these are either absent, or very small, whence the part
appears colourless. But, lower down, small yellow
granules appear in the cells, and these become bigger
and more numerous in the middle and lower parts. In
fact, few glands are better fitted for the study of the
manner in which secretion is effected than the crayfish’s
liver.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>We may now consider the alimentary machinery, the
general structure of which has been explained, in
action.</p>

<p>The food, already torn and crushed by the jaws, is
passed through the gullet into the cardiac sac, and there
reduced to a still more pulpy state by the gastric mill.
By degrees, such parts as are sufficiently fluid are
drained off into the intestine, through the pyloric strainer,
while the coarser parts of the useless matters are probably
rejected by the mouth, as a hawk or an owl rejects his
casts. There is reason to believe, though it is not certainly
known, that fluids from the intestine mix with the food
while it is undergoing trituration, and effect the transformation
of the starchy and the insoluble protein compounds
into a soluble state. At any rate, as soon as the strained-off
fluid passes into the mid-gut it must be mixed with the
secretion of the liver, the action of
which is probably <span class="xxpn" id="p068">{68}</span>
similar to that of the pancreatic juice of the higher
animals.</p>

<div class="dctr05" id="f14">

<p>The mixture thus produced, which answers to the
chyle of the higher animals, passes along the intestine,
and the greater part of it, transuding through the walls of
the alimentary canal, enters the blood, while the rest
accumulates as dark coloured fæces in the hind gut, and
is eventually passed out of the body by the vent. The
fæcal matters are small in amount, and the strainer is
so efficient that they rarely contain solid particles of
sensible size. Sometimes, however, there are a good
many minute fragments of vegetable tissue.</p>

<p>The blood of which the nutritive elements
of the food <span class="xxpn" id="p069">{69}</span>
have thus become integral parts, is a clear fluid, either
colourless, or of a pale neutral tint or reddish hue, which,
to the naked eye, appears like so much water. But if
subjected to microscopic examination, it is found to contain
innumerable pale, solid particles, or <i>corpuscles</i>,
which, when examined fresh, undergo constant changes
of form (fig.
<a href="#f14" title="go to &#x66;ig. 14">14</a>). In fact, they correspond very closely
with the colourless corpuscles which exist in our own
blood; and, in its general characters, the crayfish’s
blood is such as ours would be if it were somewhat
diluted and deprived of its red corpuscles. In other
words, it resembles our lymph more than it does our
blood. Left to itself it soon coagulates, giving rise to a
pretty firm clot.</p>

<p>The sinuses, or cavities in which the greater part of
the blood is contained, are disposed very irregularly in
the intervals between the internal organs. But there is
one of especially large size on the ventral or sternal side
of the thorax (fig.
<a href="#f15" title="go to &#x66;ig. 15">15</a>, <i>sc</i>), into which all the blood in the
body sooner or later makes its way. From this <i>sternal
sinus</i> passages (<i>av</i>) lead to the gills, and from these again
six canals (<i>bcv</i>), pass up on the inner side of the inner wall
of each branchial chamber to a cavity situated in the
dorsal region of the thorax, termed the <i>pericardium</i> (<i>p</i>),

blood. This is the cavity already mentioned as the <i>pericardium</i>
(fig.
<a href="#f15" title="go to &#x66;ig. 15">15</a>, <i>p</i>), though, as it differs in some respects
from that which is so named in the higher animals, it will
be better to term it the <i>pericardial sinus</i>.</p>

<p>The heart (fig.
<a href="#f15" title="go to &#x66;ig. 15">15</a>, <i>h</i>), lies in the midst of this sinus. It
is a thick muscular body (fig.
<a href="#f16" title="go to &#x66;ig. 16">16</a>), with an irregularly hexagonal
contour when viewed from above, one angle of the
hexagon being anterior and another posterior. The lateral
angles of the hexagon are connected by bands of fibrous tissue
(<i>ac</i>) with the walls of the pericardial sinus. Otherwise,
the heart is free, except in so far as it is kept in place by the
arteries which leave it and traverse the walls of the pericardium.
One of these arteries (figs.
<a href="#f05" title="go to &#x66;ig. 5">5</a>,
<a href="#f12" title="go to &#x66;ig. ">12</a>, and
<a href="#f16" title="go to &#x66;ig. 16">16</a>, <i>saa</i>),
starting from the hinder part of the heart, of which it
is a sort of continuation, runs along the middle line of
the abdomen above the intestine, to which it gives off
many branches. A second large artery starts from a
dilatation, which is common to it with the foregoing, but
passing directly downwards (figs.
<a href="#f12" title="go to &#x66;ig. ">12</a> and
<a href="#f15" title="go to &#x66;ig. 15">15</a>,
<i>sa</i>, and fig.
<a href="#f16" title="go to &#x66;ig. 16">16</a>,
<i>st.a</i>), either on the right or on the left side
of the intestine, <span class="xxpn" id="p072">{72}</span>
traverses the nervous cord (figs. <a href="#f12" title="go to &#x66;ig. ">12</a> and
<a href="#f15" title="go to &#x66;ig. 15">15</a>), and divides
into an anterior (fig.
<a href="#f12" title="go to &#x66;ig. 12">12</a>, <i>sa</i>) and a posterior (<i>iaa</i>) branch,
both of which run beneath and parallel with that cord.
A third artery runs, from the front part of the heart,
forwards in the middle line, over the stomach, to the
eyes and fore part of the head (figs. <a href="#f05" title="go to &#x66;ig. 5">5</a>,
<a href="#f12" title="go to &#x66;ig. ">12</a>, and
<a href="#f16" title="go to &#x66;ig. 16">16</a>, <i>oa</i>);
and two others diverge one on each side of
this, and sweep <span class="xxpn" id="p073">{73}</span>
round the stomach to the antennæ (<i>aa</i>). Behind these,
yet two other arteries are given off from the under side of
the heart, and supply the liver (<i>ha</i>). All these arteries
branch out and eventually terminate in fine, so-called
<i>capillary</i>, ramifications.</p>

superior abdominal artery; <i>st.a</i>, sternal
artery, in B cut off close to its origin.</div></div>

<p>In the dorsal wall of the heart two small oval apertures
are visible, provided with valvular lips (fig.
<a href="#f16" title="go to &#x66;ig. 16">16</a>,
<i>sa</i>), which open inwards, or towards the internal cavity
of the heart. There is a similar aperture in each of the
lateral faces of the heart (<i>la</i>), and two others in its
inferior face (<i>ia</i>), making six in all. These apertures
readily admit fluid into the heart, but oppose its exit.
On the other hand, at the origins of the arteries, there
are small valvular folds, directed in such a manner as to
permit the exit of fluid from the heart, while they prevent
its entrance.</p>

<p>The walls of the heart are muscular, and, during life,
they contract at intervals with a regular rhythm, in such
a manner as to diminish the capacity of the internal cavity
of the organ. The result is, that the blood which it
contains is driven into the arteries, and necessarily forces
into their smaller ramifications an equivalent amount of
the blood which they already contained; whence, in the
long run, the same amount of blood passes out of the
ultimate capillaries into the blood sinuses. From the
disposition of the blood sinuses, the impulse thus given
to the blood which they contain is finally conveyed to the
blood in the branchiæ, and a proportional
quantity of that <span class="xxpn" id="p074">{74}</span>
blood leaves the branchiæ and passes into the sinuses which
connect them with the pericardial sinus (fig.
<a href="#f15" title="go to &#x66;ig. 15">15</a>, <i>bcv</i>), and
thence into that cavity. At the end of the contraction,
or <i>systole</i>, of the heart, its volume is of course diminished
by the volume of the blood forced out, and the space
between the walls of the heart and those of the pericardial
sinus is increased to the same extent. This space, however,
is at once occupied by the blood from the branchiæ,
and perhaps by some blood which has not passed through
the branchiæ, though this is doubtful. When the systole
is over, the <i>diastole</i> follows; that is to say, the elasticity
of the walls of the heart and that of the various parts
which connect it with the walls of the pericardium, bring
it back to its former size, and the blood in the pericardial
sinus flows into its cavity by the six apertures. With a
new systole the same process is repeated, and thus the
blood is driven in a circular course through all parts of
the body.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>It will be observed that the branchiæ are placed in the
course of the current of blood which is returning to the
heart; which is the exact contrary of what happens in
fishes, in which the blood is sent from the heart to the
branchiæ, on its way to the body. It follows, from this
arrangement, that the blood which goes to the branchiæ
is blood in which the quantity of oxygen has undergone
a diminution, and that of carbonic acid an increase, as
compared with the blood in the heart
itself. For the <span class="xxpn" id="p075">{75}</span>
activity of all the organs, and especially of the muscles,
is inseparably connected with the absorption of oxygen
and the evolution of carbonic acid; and the only source
from which the one can be derived, and the only receptacle
into which the other can be poured, is the blood
which bathes and permeates the whole fabric to which it
is distributed by the arteries.</p>

<p>The blood, therefore, which reaches the branchiæ has
lost oxygen and gained carbonic acid; and these organs
constitute the apparatus for the elimination of the injurious
gas from the economy on the one hand, and, on the
other, for the taking in of a new supply of the needful
“vital air,” as the old chemists called it. It is thus that
the branchiæ subserve the respiratory function.</p>

<p>The crayfish has eighteen perfect and two rudimentary
branchiæ in each branchial chamber, the boundaries of
which have been already described.</p>

<p>Of the eighteen perfect branchiæ, six
(<i>podobranchiæ</i>) are attached to the basal joints
of the thoracic limbs, from the last but one to
the second (second maxillipede) inclusively (fig.
<a href="#f04" title="go to &#x66;ig. 4">4</a>,
p. 26, <i>pdb</i>, and fig.
<a href="#f17" title="go to &#x66;ig. 17">17</a>, A, B); and eleven
(<i>arthrobranchiæ</i>) are fixed to the flexible
interarticular membranes, which connect these basal
joints with the parts of the thorax to which they
are articulated (fig.
<a href="#f04" title="go to &#x66;ig. 4">4</a>, <i>arb</i>, <i>arb′</i>, fig.
<a href="#f17" title="go to &#x66;ig. 17">17</a>, C).
Of these eleven branchiæ, two are attached to the
interarticular membranes of all the ambulatory legs
but the last, (=6) and to those of the pincers and
of the external maxillipedes, (=4) and one to that
of the <span class="xxpn" id="p077">{77}</span>
second maxillipede. The first maxillipede and the last
ambulatory limb have none. Moreover, where there are
two arthrobranchiæ, one is more or less in front of
and external to the other.</p>

attached.</div></div>

<p>These eleven arthrobranchiæ are all very similar in
structure (fig.
<a href="#f17" title="go to &#x66;ig. 17">17</a>, C). Each consists of a stem which contains
two canals, one external and one internal, separated
by a longitudinal partition. The stem is beset with a great
number of delicate <i>branchial filaments</i>, so that it looks
like a plume tapering from its base to its summit. Each
filament is traversed by large vascular channels, which
break up into a net-work immediately beneath the surface.
The blood driven into the external canals of the stem (fig.
<a href="#f15" title="go to &#x66;ig. 15">15</a>, <i>av</i>) is eventually poured into the inner canal (<i>ev</i>), which
again communicates with the channels (<i>bcv</i>) which lead to
the pericardial sinus (<i>p</i>). In its course, the blood traverses
the branchial filaments, the outer investment of each of
which is an excessively thin chitinous membrane, so that
the blood contained in them is practically separated by a
mere film from the aërated water in which the gills float.
Hence, an exchange of gaseous constituents readily takes
place, and as much oxygen is taken in as carbonic acid is
given out.</p>

<p>The six podobranchiæ, or gills which are attached to
the basal joints of the legs, play the same part, but differ
a good deal in the details of their structure from those
which are fixed to the interarticular membranes. Each consists
of a broad <i>base</i> (fig.
<a href="#f17" title="go to &#x66;ig. 17">17</a>, A and B; <i>b</i>)
beset with many <span class="xxpn" id="p078">{78}</span>
fine straight hairs, or <i>setæ</i> (F), whence a narrow <i>stem</i> (<i>st</i>)
proceeds. At its upper end this stem divides into two
parts, that in front, the <i>plume</i> (<i>pl</i>), resembling the free
end of one of the gills just described, while that behind,
the <i>lamina</i> (<i>l</i>), is a broad thin plate, bent upon itself longitudinally
in such a manner that its folded edge lies forwards,
and covered with minute hooked setæ (G). The
gill which follows is received into the space included
between the two lobes or halves of the folded lamina
(fig. <a href="#f04" title="go to &#x66;ig. 4">4</a>, p. 26). Each lobe is longitudinally plaited into
about a dozen folds. The whole front and outer face of
the stem is beset with branchial filaments; hence, we may
compare one of these branchiæ to one of the preceding
kind, in which the stem has become modified and has
given off a large folded lamina from its inner and
posterior face.</p>

<p>The branchiæ now described are arranged in sets of
three for each of the thoracic limbs, from the third
maxillipede to the last but one ambulatory limb, and
two for the second maxillipede, thus making seventeen
in all (3&#x2009;×&#x202f;5&#x2009;+&#x202f;2&#x2009;=&#x202f;17);
and, between every two there is found a bundle of long
twisted hairs (fig.
<a href="#f17" title="go to &#x66;ig. 17">17</a>, A, <i>cx.s</i>; D and E), which are
attached to a small elevation (<i>t</i>) on the basal joint
of each limb. These <i>coxopoditic setæ</i>, no doubt,
serve to prevent the intrusion of parasites and other
foreign matters into the branchial chamber. From the
mode of attachment of the six branchiæ it is obvious
that they must share in the movements of the basal
joints of the <span class="xxpn" id="p079">{79}</span>
legs; and that, when the crayfish walks, they must be
more or less agitated in the branchial chamber.</p>

<p>The eighteenth branchia resembles one of the eleven
arthrobranchiæ in structure; but it is larger, and it is
attached neither to the basal joint of the hindermost ambulatory
limb, nor to its interarticular membrane, but to the
sides of the thorax, above the joint. From this mode of
attachment it is distinguished from the others as <i>pleurobranchia</i>
(fig.
<a href="#f04" title="go to &#x66;ig. 4">4</a>, <i>plb. 14</i>).</p>

<p>Finally, in front of this, fixed also to the walls of the
thorax, above each of the two preceding pairs of ambulatory
limbs, there is a delicate filament, about a sixteenth of
an inch long, which has the structure of a branchial
filament, and is, in fact, a rudimentary pleurobranchia
(fig.
<a href="#f04" title="go to &#x66;ig. 4">4</a>, <i>plb. 12</i>, <i>plb. 13</i>).</p>

<p>The quantity of water which occupies the space left in
the branchial chamber by the gills is but small, and as
the respiratory surface offered by the gills is relatively
very large, the air contained in this water must be
rapidly exhausted, even when the crayfish is quiescent;
while, when any muscular exertion takes place, the quantity
of carbonic acid formed, and the demand for fresh
oxygen, is at once greatly increased. For the efficient
performance of the function of respiration, therefore, the
water in the branchial chamber must be rapidly renewed,
and there must be some arrangement by which the
supply of fresh water may be proportioned to the
demand. In many animals, the
respiratory surface is <span class="xxpn" id="p080">{80}</span>
covered with rapidly vibrating filaments, or <i>cilia</i>, by
means of which a current of water is kept continually
flowing over the gills, but there are none of these
in the crayfish. The same object is attained, however, in
another way. The anterior boundary of the branchial
chamber corresponds with the cervical groove, which, as
has been seen, curves downwards and then forwards,
until it terminates at the sides of the space occupied by
the jaws. If the branchiostegite is cut away along the
groove, it will be found that it is attached to the sides of
the head, which project a little beyond the anterior part
of the thorax, so that there is a depression behind the
sides of the head—just as there is a depression, behind a
man’s jaw, at the sides of the neck. Between this
depression in front, the walls of the thorax internally,
the branchiostegite externally, and the bases of the forceps
and external foot-jaws below, a curved canal is included,
by which the branchial cavity opens forwards as by
a funnel. Attached to the base of the second maxilla
there is a wide curved plate (fig, 4, <i>6</i>) which fits
against the projection of the head, as a shirt collar might
do, to carry out our previous comparison; and this scoop-shaped
plate (termed the <i>scaphognathite</i>), which is concave
forwards and convex backwards, can be readily
moved backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>If a living crayfish is taken out of the water, it will
be found that, as the water drains away from the branchial
cavity, bubbles of air are forced out of
its anterior opening. <span class="xxpn" id="p081">{81}</span>
Again, if, when a crayfish is resting quietly in the water,
a little coloured fluid is allowed to run down towards
the posterior opening of the branchial chamber, it will
very soon be driven out from the anterior aperture,
with considerable force, in a long stream. In fact, as
the scaphognathite vibrates not less than three or four
times in a second, the water in the funnel-shaped front
passage of the branchial cavity is incessantly baled out;
and, as fresh water flows in from behind to make up the
loss, a current is kept constantly flowing over the gills.
The rapidity of this current naturally depends on the
more or less quick repetition of the strokes of the
scaphognathite; and hence, the activity of the respiratory
function can be accurately adjusted to the wants of
the economy. Slow working of the scaphognathite
answers to ordinary breathing in ourselves, quick working
to panting.</p>

<p>A farther self-adjustment of the respiratory apparatus
is gained by the attachment of the six gills to the basal
joints of the legs. For, when the animal exerts its
muscles in walking, these gills are agitated, and thus not
only bring their own surfaces more largely in contact with
the water, but produce the same effect upon the other
gills.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The constant oxidation which goes on in all parts of
the body not only gives rise to carbonic acid; but, so far
as it affects the proteinaceous
constituents, it produces <span class="xxpn" id="p082">{82}</span>
compounds which contain nitrogen, and these, like other
waste products, must be eliminated. In the higher
animals, such waste products take the form of urea, uric
acid, hippuric acid, and the like; and are got rid of by
the kidneys. We may, therefore, expect to find some
organ which plays the part of a kidney in the crayfish;
but the position of the structure, which there is much
reason for regarding as the representative of the kidney,
is so singular that very different interpretations have
been put upon it.</p>

<p>On the basal joint of each antenna it is easy to see a
small conical eminence with an opening on the inner side
of its summit (fig.
<a href="#f18" title="go to &#x66;ig. 18">18</a>). The aperture (<i>x</i>) leads by a
short canal into a spacious sac, with extremely delicate
walls (<i>s</i>), which is lodged in the front part of the head, in
front of and below the cardiac division of the stomach (<i>cs</i>).
Beneath this, in a sort of recess, which corresponds with
the epistoma, and with the base of the antenna, there is a
discoidal body of a dull green colour, in shape somewhat
like one of the fruits of the mallow, which is known as
the <i>green gland</i> (<i>gg</i>) The sac narrows below like a wide
funnel, and the edges of its small end are continuous with
the walls of the green gland; they surround an aperture
which leads into the interior of the latter structure, and
conveys its products into the sac, whence they are excreted
by the opening in the antennary papilla. The green gland
is said to contain a substance termed <i>guanin</i> (so named
because it is found in the <i>guano</i> which
is the accumulated <span class="xxpn" id="p083">{83}</span>
excrement of birds), a nitrogenous body analogous in
some respects to uric acid, but less highly oxidated;
and if this be the case, there can be little doubt that
the green gland represents the kidney,
and its secretion <span class="xxpn" id="p084">{84}</span>
the urinary fluid, while the sac is a sort of urinary
bladder.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Restricting our attention to the phenomena which have
now been described, and to a short period in the life of
the crayfish, the body of the animal may be regarded
as a factory, provided with various pieces of machinery,
by means of which certain nitrogenous and other matters
are extracted from the animal and vegetable substances
which serve for food, are oxidated, and are then delivered
out of the factory in the shape of carbonic acid gas,
guanin, and probably some other products, with which
we are at present unacquainted. And there is no doubt,
that if the total amount of products given out could be
accurately weighed against the total amount of materials
taken in, the weight of the two would be found to be
identical. To put the matter in its most general shape,
the body of the crayfish is a sort of focus to which certain
material particles converge, in which they move for a
time, and from which they are afterwards expelled in new
combinations. The parallel between a whirlpool in a
stream and a living being, which has often been drawn, is
as just as it is striking. The whirlpool is permanent,
but the particles of water which constitute it are incessantly
changing. Those which enter it, on the one
side, are whirled around and temporarily constitute a part
of its individuality; and as they leave it on the other
side, their places are made good
by new comers. <span class="xxpn" id="p085">{85}</span></p>

<p>Those who have seen the wonderful whirlpool, three
miles below the Falls of Niagara, will not have forgotten
the heaped-up wave which tumbles and tosses, a very
embodiment of restless energy, where the swift stream
hurrying from the Falls is compelled to make a sudden
turn towards Lake Ontario. However changeful in the
contour of its crest, this wave has been visible, approximately
in the same place, and with the same general
form, for centuries past. Seen from a mile off, it would
appear to be a stationary hillock of water. Viewed closely,
it is a typical expression of the conflicting impulses
generated by a swift rush of material particles.</p>

<p>Now, with all our appliances, we cannot get within
a good many miles, so to speak, of the crayfish. If we
could, we should see that it was nothing but the constant
form of a similar turmoil of material molecules which
are constantly flowing into the animal on the one side,
and streaming out on the other.</p>

<p>The chemical changes which take place in the body of
the crayfish, are doubtless, like other chemical changes,
accompanied by the evolution of heat. But the amount
of heat thus generated is so small and, in consequence
of the conditions under which the crayfish lives, it is so
easily carried away, that it is practically insensible. The
crayfish has approximately the temperature of the surrounding
medium, and it is, therefore, reckoned among
the cold-blooded animals.</p>

<p>If our investigation of the results of
the process of <span class="xxpn" id="p086">{86}</span>
alimentation in a well-fed Crayfish were extended over a
longer time, say a year or two, we should find that the
products given out were no longer equal to the materials
taken in, and the balance would be found in the increase
of the animal’s weight. If we inquired how the balance
was distributed, we should find it partly in store, chiefly
in the shape of fat; while, in part, it had been spent in
increasing the plant and in enlarging the factory. That
is to say, it would have supplied the material for the
animal’s growth. And this is one of the most remarkable
respects in which the living factory differs from
those which we construct. It not only enlarges itself,
but, as we have seen, it is capable of executing its own
repairs to a very considerable extent.</p>

<span class="hsmall">
THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE CRAY­FISH—THE MECH­A­NISM BY
WHICH THE LIV­ING OR­GAN­ISM AD­JUSTS IT­SELF TO
SUR­ROUND­ING CON­DI­TIONS AND RE­PRO­DUCES IT­SELF.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">If the hand is brought near a
vigorous crayfish, free to move in a large vessel of
water, it will generally give a vigorous flap with
its tail, and dart backwards out of reach; but if a
piece of meat is gently lowered into the vessel, the
crayfish will sooner or later approach and devour
it.</p>

<p>If we ask why the crayfish behaves in this fashion,
every one has an answer ready. In the first case, it is
said that the animal is aware of danger, and therefore
hastens away; in the second, that it knows that meat is
good to eat, and therefore walks towards it and makes a
meal. And nothing can seem to be simpler or more
satisfactory than these replies, until we attempt to conceive
clearly what they mean; and, then, the explanation,
however simple it may be admitted to be, hardly retains
its satisfactory character.</p>

<p>For example, when we say that the crayfish is “aware
of danger,” or “knows that meat is good
to eat,” what <span class="xxpn" id="p088">{88}</span>
do we mean by “being aware” and “knowing”?
Certainly it cannot be meant that the crayfish says to
himself, as we do, “This is dangerous,” “That is nice;”
for the crayfish, being devoid of language, has nothing to
say either to himself or any one else. And if the crayfish
has not language enough to construct a proposition,
it is obviously out of the question that his actions should
be guided by a logical reasoning process, such as that
by which a man would justify similar actions. The
crayfish assuredly does not first frame the syllogism,
“Dangerous things are to be avoided; that hand is
dangerous; therefore it is to be avoided;” and then act
upon the conclusion thus logically drawn.</p>

<p>But it may be said that children, before they acquire
the use of language, and we ourselves, long after we are
familiar with conscious reasoning, perform a great variety
of perfectly rational acts unconsciously. A child grasps
at a sweetmeat, or cowers before a threatening gesture,
before it can speak; and any one of us would start back
from a chasm opening at our feet, or stoop to pick up a
jewel from the ground, “without thinking about it.”
And, no doubt, if the crayfish has any mind at all, his
mental operations must more or less resemble those which
the human mind performs without giving them a spoken
or unspoken verbal embodiment.</p>

<p>If we analyse these, we shall find that, in many cases,
distinctly felt sensations are followed by a distinct desire
to perform some act, which act
is accordingly performed; <span class="xxpn" id="p089">{89}</span>
while, in other cases, the act follows the sensation without
one being aware of any other mental process; and,
in yet others, there is no consciousness even of the sensation.
As I wrote these last words, for example, I had
not the slightest consciousness of any sensation of holding
or guiding the pen, although my fingers were causing
that instrument to perform exceedingly complicated
movements. Moreover, experiments upon animals have
proved that consciousness is wholly unnecessary to the
carrying out of many of those combined movements by
which the body is adjusted to varying external conditions.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it is really quite an open
question whether a crayfish has a mind or not; moreover,
the problem is an absolutely insoluble one, inasmuch
as nothing short of being a crayfish would give us
positive assurance that such an animal possesses consciousness;
and, finally, supposing the crayfish has a
mind, that fact does not explain its acts, but only shows
that, in the course of their accomplishment, they are
accompanied by phenomena similar to those of which
we are aware in ourselves, under like circumstances.</p>

<p>So we may as well leave this question of the crayfish’s
mind on one side for the present, and turn to a more
profitable investigation, namely, that of the order and
connexion of the physical phenomena which intervene
between something which happens in the neighbourhood
of the animal and that other something which responds
to it, as an act
of the crayfish. <span class="xxpn" id="p090">{90}</span></p>

<p>Whatever else it may be, this animal, so far as it is
acted upon by bodies around it and reacts on them, is a
piece of mechanism, the internal works of which give rise
to certain movements when it is affected by particular
external conditions; and they do this in virtue of their
physical properties and connexions.</p>

<p>Every movement of the body, or of any organ of the
body, is an effect of one and the same cause, namely,
muscular contraction. Whether the crayfish swims or
walks, or moves its antennæ, or seizes its prey, the immediate
cause of the movements of the parts which bring
about, or constitute, these bodily motions is to be sought
in a change which takes place in the flesh, or muscle,
which is attached to them. The change of place which
constitutes any movement is an effect of a previous
change in the disposition of the molecules of one
or more muscles; while the direction of that movement
depends on the connexions of the parts of the
skeleton with one another, and of the muscles with
them.</p>

<p>The muscle of the crayfish is a dense, white substance;
and if a small portion of it is subjected to examination it
will be found to be very easily broken up into more
or less parallel bundles of fine fibres. Each of these
fibres is generally found to be ensheathed in a fine transparent
membrane, which is called the <i>sarcolemma</i>, within
which is contained the proper substance of the muscle.
When quite fresh and living, this substance
is soft and <span class="xxpn" id="p091">{91}</span>
semi-fluid, but it hardens and becomes solid immediately
after death.</p>

<p>Examined, with high magnifying
powers, in this <span class="xxpn" id="p092">{92}</span>
condition, the muscle-substance appears marked by very
regular transverse bands, which are alternately opaque
and transparent; and it is characteristic of the group of
animals to which the crayfish belongs that their muscle-substance
has this striped character in all parts of the
body.</p>

<p>A greater or less number of these fibres, united into one
or more bundles, constitutes a muscle; and, except when
these muscles surround a cavity, they are fixed at each
end to the hard parts of the skeleton. The attachment
is frequently effected by the intermediation of a dense,
fibrous, often chitinous, substance, which constitutes the
<i>tendon</i> (fig.
<a href="#f19" title="go to &#x66;ig. 19">19</a>, A; <i>t</i>) of the muscle.</p>

<p>The property of the living muscle, which enables it to
be the cause of motion, is this: Every muscular fibre is
capable of suddenly changing its dimensions, in such a
manner that it shortens and becomes proportionately
thicker. Hence the absolute bulk of the fibre remains
practically unchanged. From this circumstance, muscular
<i>contraction</i>, as the change of form of a muscle is called,
is radically different from the process which commonly
goes by the same name in other things, and which
involves a diminution of bulk.</p>

<p>The contraction of muscle takes place with great force,
and, of course, if the parts to which its ends are fixed
are both free to move, they are brought nearer at the
moment of contraction: if one only is free to move that
is approximated to the fixed part; and
if the muscular <span class="xxpn" id="p093">{93}</span>
fibre surrounds a cavity, the cavity is lessened when the
muscle contracts. This is the whole source of motor
power in the crayfish machine. The results produced
by the exertion of that power depend upon the manner
in which the parts to which the muscles are attached
are connected with one another.</p>

<p>One example of this has already been given in the
curious mechanism of the gastric mill. Another may be
found in the chela which terminates the
forceps. If the <span class="xxpn" id="p094">{94}</span>
articulation of the last joint (fig.
<a href="#f20" title="go to &#x66;ig. 20">20</a>, <i>dp</i>) with the one which
precedes it (<i>prp</i>) is examined, it will be found that the
base of the terminal segment (<i>dp</i>) turns on two hinges (<i>x</i>),
formed by the hard exoskeleton and situated at opposite
points of the diameter of the base, on the penultimate
segment; and these hinges are so disposed that the
last joint can be moved only in one plane, to or from
the produced angle of the penultimate segment (<i>prp</i>),
which forms the fixed claw of the chela. Between the
hinges, on both the inner and the outer sides of the
articulation, the exoskeleton is soft and flexible, and
allows the terminal segment to play easily through a
certain arc. It is by this arrangement that the direction
and the extent of the motion of the free claw of the chela
are determined. The source of the motion lies in the
muscles which occupy the interior of the enlarged penultimate
segment of the limb. Two muscles, one of very
great size (<i>m</i>), the other smaller (<i>m′</i>), are fastened by
one end to the exoskeleton of this segment. The fibres of
the larger muscle converge to be fixed into the two sides
of a long flat process of the chitinous cuticula, on the
inner side of the base of the terminal segment, which
serves as a tendon (<i>t</i>); while those of the smaller muscle
are similarly attached to a like process which proceeds
from the outer side of the base of the terminal segment
(<i>t′</i>). It is obvious that, when the latter muscle
shortens it must move the apex of the terminal segment
(<i>dp</i>) away from the end of the
fixed claw; while, <span class="xxpn" id="p095">{95}</span>
when the former contracts, the end of the terminal
segment is brought towards that of the fixed claw.</p>

<p>A living crayfish is able to perform very varied movements
with its pincers. When it swims backwards, these
limbs are stretched straight out, parallel with one another,
in front of the head; when it walks, they are usually
carried like arms bent at the elbow, the “forearm”
partly resting on the ground; on being irritated, the
crayfish sweeps the pincers round in any direction to
grasp the offending body; when prey is seized, it is at
once conveyed, with a circular motion, towards the region
of the mouth. Nevertheless, these very varied actions
are all brought about by a combination of simple flexions
and extensions, each of which is effected in the exact
order, and to the exact extent, needful to bring the chela
into the position required.</p>

<p>The skeleton of the stem of the limb which bears the
chela is, in fact, divided into four moveable segments;
and each of these is articulated with the segments on
each side of it by a hinge of just the same character as
that which connects the moveable claw of the chela with
the penultimate segment, while the basal segment is
similarly articulated with the thorax.</p>

<p>If the axes of all these articulations<a class="afnanc" href="#fn7" id="fnanc7">7</a>
were parallel, it is
obvious that, though the limb might be moved as a whole
through a considerable arc, and might be
bent in various <span class="xxpn" id="p096">{96}</span>
degrees, yet all its movements would be limited to one
plane. But, in fact, the axes of the successive articulations
are nearly at right angles to one another; so that,
if the segments are successively either extended or
flexed, the chela describes a very complicated curve;
and by varying the extent of flexion or extension of
each segment, this curve is susceptible of endless variation.
It would probably puzzle a good mathematician
to say exactly what position should be given to each
segment, in order to bring the chela from any given
position into any other; but if a lively crayfish is
incautiously seized, the experimenter will find, to his
cost, that the animal solves the problem both rapidly
and accurately.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc7"
id="fn7">7</a> By axis of the articulation is meant a
line drawn through the pair of hinges which constitute
it.</p></div>

<p>The mechanism by which the retrograde swimming of
the crayfish is effected, is no less easily analysed. The
apparatus of motion is, as we have seen, the abdomen,
with its terminal five-pointed flapper. The rings of the
abdomen are articulated together by joints
(fig. <a href="#f21" title="go to &#x66;ig. 21">21</a>, ×)
situated a little below the middle of the height of the
rings, at opposite ends of transverse lines, at right
angles to the long axis of the abdomen.</p>

<p>Each ring consists of a dorsal, arched portion, called the
<i>tergum</i> (fig. <a href="#f21" title="go to &#x66;ig. 21">21</a>;
fig. <a href="#f36" title="go to &#x66;ig. 36">36</a>, p. 142, <i>t. XIX</i>), and a nearly
flat ventral portion, which is the <i>sternum</i> (fig.
<a href="#f36" title="go to &#x66;ig. 36">36</a>, <i>st.
XIX</i>). Where these two join, a broad plate is sent down
on each side, which overlaps the bases of the abdominal
appendages, and is known as the <i>pleuron</i> (fig.
<a href="#f36" title="go to &#x66;ig. 36">36</a>, <i>pl.
XIX</i>). <span class="xxpn" id="p097">{97}</span>
The sterna are all very narrow, and are
connected together by wide spaces of flexible exoskeleton.</p>

<div class="dctr06" id="f21">

<div class="dcaption">
<span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span> 21.—<i>Astacus
fluviatilis.</i>—Two of the abdominal somites, in vertical
section, seen from the inner side, to show ×, ×, the hinges
by which they are articulated with one another (×&#x202f;3). The
anterior of the two somites is that to the right of the
figure.</div></div>

<p>When the abdomen is made straight, it will be found
that these <i>intersternal</i> membranes are stretched as far
as they will yield. On the other hand, when the abdomen
is bent up as far as it will go, the sterna come close
together, and the intersternal membranes are folded.</p>

<p>The terga are very broad; so broad, in fact, that each
overlaps its successor, when the abdomen is straightened
or extended, for nearly half its length in the middle
line; and the overlapped surface is
smooth, convex, and <span class="xxpn" id="p098">{98}</span>
marked off by a transverse groove from the rest of the
tergum as an <i>articular facet</i>. The front edge of the
articular facet is continued into a sheet of flexible cuticula,
which turns back, and passes as a loose fold to the
hinder edge of the overlapping tergum (fig.
<a href="#f21" title="go to &#x66;ig. 21">21</a>). This
tergal <i>interarticular membrane</i> allows the terga to move as
far as they can go in flexion; whilst, in extreme extension,
they are but slightly stretched. But, even if the intersternal
membranes presented no obstacle to excessive
extension of the abdomen, the posterior free edge of each
tergum fits into the groove behind the facet in the next
in such a manner, that the abdomen cannot be made more
than very slightly concave upwards without breaking.</p>

<p>Thus the limits of motion of the abdomen, in the
vertical direction, are from the position in which it is
straight, or has even a very slight upward concavity, to
that in which it is completely bent upon itself, the telson
being brought under the bases of the hinder thoracic
limbs. No lateral movement between the somites of the
abdomen is possible in any of its positions. For, when
it is straight, lateral movement is hindered not only by
the extensive overlapping of the terga, but also by the
manner in which the hinder edges of the pleura of each
of the four middle somites overlap the front edges of
their successors. The pleura of the second somite are
much larger than any of the others, and their front edges
overlap the small pleura of the first abdominal somite;
and when the abdomen is much flexed,
these pleura even <span class="xxpn" id="p099">{99}</span>
ride over the posterior edges of the branchiostegites. In
the position of extension, the overlap of the terga is great,
while that of the pleura of the middle somites is small.
As the abdomen passes from extension to flexion, the
overlap of the terga of course diminishes; but any decrease
of resistance to lateral strains which may thus
arise, is compensated by the increasing overlap of the
pleura, which reaches its maximum when the abdomen
is completely flexed.</p>

<p>It is obvious that longitudinal muscular fibres fixed
into the exoskeleton, above the axes of the joints, must
bring the centres of the terga of the somites closer
together, when they contract; while muscular fibres
attached below the axes of the joints must approximate
the sterna. Hence, the former will give rise to extension,
and the latter to flexion, of the abdomen as a whole.</p>

<p>Now there are two pairs of very considerable muscles
disposed in this manner. The dorsal pair, or the <i>extensors</i>
of the abdomen (fig.
<a href="#f22" title="go to &#x66;ig. 22">22</a>, <i>e.m</i>), are attached in front
to the side walls of the thorax, thence pass backwards
into the abdomen, and divide into bundles, which are
fixed to the inner surfaces of the terga of all the somites.
The other pair, or the <i>flexors</i> of the abdomen (<i>f.m</i>) constitute
a very much larger mass of muscle, the fibres of
which are curiously twisted, like the strands of a rope.
The front end of this double rope is fixed to a series of
processes of the exoskeleton of the thorax, called <i>apodemata</i>,
some of which roof over
the sternal blood-sinuses <span class="xxpn" id="p100">{100}</span>
and the thoracic part of the nervous system; while, in the
abdomen, its strands are attached to the sternal exoskeleton
of all the somites and extend, on each side of the
rectum, to the telson.</p>

<p>When the exoskeleton is cleaned by maceration, the
abdomen has a slight curve, dependent upon the form and
the degree of elasticity possessed by its different parts;
and, in a living crayfish at rest, it will be observed that
the curvature of the abdomen is still more marked.
Hence it is ready either for extension or for flexion.</p>

<p>A sudden contraction of the flexor muscles instantly
increases the ventral curvature of
the abdomen, and <span class="xxpn" id="p101">{101}</span>
throws the tail fin, the two side lobes of which are
spread out, forwards; while the body is propelled backwards
by the reaction of the water against the stroke.
Then the flexor muscles being relaxed, the extensor
muscles come into play; the abdomen is straightened, but
less violently and with a far weaker stroke on the water,
in consequence of the less strength of the extensors and of
the folding up of the lateral plates of the fin, until it
comes into the position requisite to give full force to a
new downward and forward stroke. The tendency of the
extension of the abdomen is to drive the body forward;
but from the comparative weakness and the obliquity of
its stroke, its practical effect is little more than to check
the backward motion conferred upon the body by the
flexion of the abdomen.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Thus, every action of the crayfish, which involves
motion, means the contraction of one or more muscles.
But what sets muscle contracting? A muscle freshly
removed from the body may be made to contract in
various ways, as by mechanical or chemical irritation, or
by an electrical shock; but, under natural conditions,
there is only one cause of muscular contraction, and that
is the activity of a nerve. Every muscle is supplied with
one or more nerves. These are delicate threads which,
on microscopic examination, prove to be bundles of fine
tubular filaments, filled with an apparently structureless
substance of gelatinous consistency,
the <i>nerve fibres</i> <span class="xxpn" id="p102">{102}</span>
(fig.
<a href="#f23" title="go to &#x66;ig. 23">23</a>). The nerve bundle which passes to a muscle
breaks up into smaller bundles and, finally, into separate
fibres, each of which ultimately terminates by becoming
continuous with the substance of a muscular fibre (fig.
<a href="#f19" title="go to &#x66;ig. 19">19</a>,
F). Now the peculiarity of a muscle nerve, or <i>motor</i>
nerve, as it is called, is that irritation of the nerve fibre at
any part of its length, however distant from the muscle,
brings about muscular contraction, just as if the muscle
itself were irritated. A change is produced in the molecular
condition of the nerve at the point of irritation;
and this change is propagated along the nerve, until it
reaches the muscle, in which it gives rise to that change
in the arrangement of its molecules, the most obvious
effect of which is the sudden alteration of form which we
call muscular contraction.</p>

<p>The chief ganglia of the crayfish are disposed in a
longitudinal series in the middle line of the ventral
aspect of the body close to the integument (fig.
<a href="#f25" title="go to &#x66;ig. 25">25</a>).
In the abdomen, for example, six ganglionic masses are
readily observed, one lying over the sternum of each
somite, connected by longitudinal bands of nerve fibres,
and giving off branches to the muscles. On careful examination,
the longitudinal connecting bands, or <i>commissures</i>
(fig.
<a href="#f24" title="go to &#x66;ig. 24">24</a>, <i>co</i>), are seen to be double, and each
mass appears slightly bilobed. In the thorax, there are
six, larger, double ganglionic masses, likewise connected
by double commissures; and the most anterior of these,
which is the largest (fig.
<a href="#f25" title="go to &#x66;ig. 25">25</a>, <i>gn.</i> 2), is marked at the
sides by notches, as if it were made up of several pairs
of ganglia, run together into one continuous whole.
In front of this, two commissures (<i>c</i>) pass forwards,
separating widely, to give room for the gullet (<i>œs</i>), which
passes between them; while in front of the gullet, just
behind the eyes, they unite with a transversely elongated
mass of ganglionic substance (<i>gn.</i> 1), termed the <i>brain</i>, or
<i>cerebral ganglion</i>.</p>

<p>All the motor nerves, as has been said, are traceable,
directly or indirectly, to one or other of these thirteen
sets of ganglia; but other nerves are given off from the
ganglia, which cannot be followed into
any muscle. In <span class="xxpn" id="p106">{106}</span>
fact, these nerves go either to the integument or to the
organs of sense, and they are termed <i>sensory nerves</i>.</p>

<p>When a muscle is connected by its motor nerve with
a ganglion, irritation of that ganglion will bring about
the contraction of the muscle, as well as if the motor
nerve itself were irritated. Not only so; but if a sensory
nerve, which is in connexion with the ganglion, is irritated,
the same effect is produced; moreover, the sensory nerve
itself need not be excited, but the same result will
take place, if the organ to which it is distributed is
stimulated. Thus the nervous system is fundamentally
an apparatus by which two separate, and it may be distant,
parts of the body, are brought into relation with
one another; and this relation is of such a nature, that
a change of state arising in the one part is followed by
the propagation of changes along the sensory nerve to the
ganglion, and from the ganglion to the other part; where,
if that part happens to be muscle, it produces contraction.
If one end of a rod of wood, twenty feet long, is applied
to a sounding-board, the sound of a tuning-fork held
against the opposite extremity will be very plainly heard.
Nothing can be seen to happen in the wood, and yet
its molecules are certainly set vibrating, at the same
rate as the tuning-fork vibrates; and when, after
travelling rapidly along the wood, these vibrations
affect the sounding-board, they give rise to vibrations
of the molecules of the air, which reaching the ear, are
converted into an audible note. So in
the nerve tract: <span class="xxpn" id="p107">{107}</span>
no apparent change is effected in it by the irritation at
one end; but the rate at which the molecular change
produced travels can be measured; and, when it reaches
the muscle, its effect becomes visible in the change of
form of the muscle. The molecular change would take
place just as much if there were no muscle connected
with the nerve, but it would be no more apparent to
ordinary observation than the sound of the tuning-fork
is audible in the absence of the sounding-board.</p>

<p>If the nervous system were a mere bundle of nerve
fibres extending between sensory organs and muscles,
every muscular contraction would require the stimulation
of that special point of the surface on which the appropriate
sensory nerve ended. The contraction of several
muscles at the same time, that is, the combination of
movements towards one end, would be possible only if the
appropriate nerves were severally stimulated in the proper
order, and every movement would be the direct result of external
changes. The organism would be like a piano, which
may be made to give out the most complicated harmonies,
but is dependent for their production on the depression
of a separate key for every note that is sounded. But it
is obvious that the crayfish needs no such separate
impulses for the performance of highly complicated
actions. The simple impression made on the organs of
sensation in the two examples with which we started,
gives rise to a train of complicated and accurately co-ordinated
muscular contractions. To
carry the analogy <span class="xxpn" id="p108">{108}</span>
of the musical instrument further, striking a single key
gives rise, not to a single note, but to a more or less
elaborate tune; as if the hammer struck not a single
string, but pressed down the stop of a musical box.</p>

<p>It is in the ganglia that we must look for the analogue
of the musical box. A single impulse conveyed by a
sensory nerve to a ganglion, may give rise to a single
muscular contraction, but more commonly it originates a
series of such, combined to a definite end.</p>

<p>The effect which results from the propagation of an
impulse along a nerve fibre to a ganglionic centre, whence
it is, as it were, reflected along another nerve fibre to a
muscle, is what is termed a <i>reflex action</i>. As it is by no
means necessary that sensation should be a concomitant
of the first impulse, it is better to term the nerve fibre
which carries it <i>afferent</i> rather than sensory; and, as
other phenomena besides those of molar motion may be
the ultimate result of the reflex action, it is better to
term the nerve fibre which transmits the reflected impulse
<i>efferent</i> rather than motor.</p>

<p>If the nervous commissures between the last thoracic
and the first abdominal ganglia are cut, or if the thoracic
ganglia are destroyed, the crayfish is no longer able to
control the movements of the abdomen. If the forepart
of the body is irritated, for example, the animal makes
no effort to escape by swimming backwards. Nevertheless,
the abdomen is not paralysed, for, if it be irritated,
it will flap vigorously. This is a
case of pure <span class="xxpn" id="p109">{109}</span>
reflex action. The stimulus is conveyed to the abdominal
ganglia through afferent nerves, and is reflected
from them, by efferent nerves, to the abdominal muscles.</p>

<p>But this is not all. Under these circumstances it will
be seen that the abdominal limbs all swing backwards
and forwards, simultaneously, with an even stroke; while
the vent opens and shuts with a regular rhythm. Of
course, these movements imply correspondingly regular
alternate contractions and relaxations of certain sets of
muscles; and these, again, imply regularly recurring
efferent impulses from the abdominal ganglia. The fact
that these impulses proceed from the abdominal ganglia,
may be shown in two ways: first, by destroying these
ganglia in one somite after another, when the movements
in each somite at once permanently cease; and,
secondly, by irritating the surface of the abdomen, when
the movements are temporarily inhibited by the stimulation
of the afferent nerves. Whether these movements are
properly reflex, that is, arise from incessant new afferent
impulses of unknown origin, or whether they depend on the
periodical accumulation and discharge of nervous energy in
the ganglia themselves, or upon periodical exhaustion and
restoration of the irritability of the muscles, is unknown.
It is sufficient for the present purpose to use the facts as
evidence of the peculiar co-ordinative function of ganglia.</p>

<p>The crayfish, as we have seen, avoids light; and the
slightest touch of one of its antennæ gives rise to active
motions of the whole body. In
fact, the animal’s <span class="xxpn" id="p110">{110}</span>
position and movements are largely determined by the influences
received through the feelers and the eyes. These
receive their nerves from the cerebral ganglia; and, as
might be expected, when these ganglia are extirpated,
the crayfish exhibits no tendency to get away from the
light, and the feelers may not only be touched, but
sharply pinched, without effect. Clearly, therefore, the
cerebral ganglia serve as a ganglionic centre, by which
the afferent impulses derived from the feelers and the
eyes are transmuted into efferent impulses. Another
very curious result follows upon the extirpation of the
cerebral ganglia. If an uninjured crayfish is placed upon
its back, it makes unceasing and well-directed efforts to
turn over; and if everything else fails, it will give a
powerful flap with the abdomen, and trust to the chapter
of accidents to turn over as it darts back. But the
brainless crayfish behaves in a very different way. Its
limbs are in incessant motion, but they are “all abroad;”
and if it turns over on one side, it does not seem able
to steady itself, but rolls on to its back again.</p>

<p>If anything is put between the chelæ of an uninjured
crayfish, while on its back, it either rejects the object at
once, or tries to make use of it for leverage to turn over.
In the brainless crayfish a similar operation gives rise to
a very curious spectacle.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn8" id="fnanc8">8</a>
If the
object, whatever it <span class="xxpn" id="p111">{111}</span>
be—a bit of metal, or wood, or paper, or one of the animal’s
own antennæ—is placed between the chelæ of the
forceps, it is at once seized by them, and carried backwards;
the chelate ambulatory limbs are at the same
time advanced, the object seized is transferred to them,
and they at once tuck it between the external maxillipedes,
which, with the other jaws, begin vigorously to
masticate it. Sometimes the morsel is swallowed;
sometimes it passes out between the anterior jaws, as if
deglutition were difficult. It is very singular to observe
that, if the morsel which is being conveyed to the mouth
by one of the forceps is pulled back, the forceps and the
chelate ambulatory limbs of the other side are at once
brought forward to secure it. The movements of the
limbs are, in short, adjusted to meet the increased
resistance.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc8" id="fn8">8</a>
My attention was first drawn to these phenomena by my friend
Dr. M. Foster, F.R.S., to whom I had suggested the desirableness of
an experimental study of the nerve physiology of the crayfish.</p></div>

<p>All these phenomena cease at once, if the thoracic
ganglia are destroyed. It is in these, therefore, that the
simple stimulus set up by the contact of a body with, for
example, one of the forceps, is translated into all the surprisingly
complex and accurately co-ordinated movements,
which have been described. Thus the nervous system
of the crayfish may be regarded as a system of co-ordinating
mechanisms, each of which produces a certain
action, or set of actions, on the receipt of an appropriate
stimulus.</p>

<p>When the crayfish comes into the world, it possesses
in its neuro-muscular
apparatus certain innate <span class="xxpn" id="p112">{112}</span>
potentialities of action, and will exhibit the corresponding
acts, under the influence of the appropriate stimuli.
A large proportion of these stimuli come from without
through the organs of the senses. The greater or less
readiness of each sense organ to receive impulses, of
the nerves to transmit them, and of the ganglia to
give rise to combined impulses, is dependent at any
moment upon the physical condition of these parts; and
this, again, is largely modified by the amount and the
condition of the blood supplied. On the other hand, a
certain number of these stimuli are doubtless originated
by changes within the various organs which compose the
body, including the nerve centres themselves.</p>

<p>When an action arises from conditions developed in
the interior of an animal’s body, inasmuch as we cannot
perceive the antecedent phenomena, we call such an
action “spontaneous;” or, when in ourselves we are
aware that it is accompanied by the idea of the action,
and the desire to perform it, we term the act “voluntary.”
But, by the use of this language, no rational
person intends to express the belief that such acts are
uncaused or cause themselves. “Self-causation” is a
contradiction in terms; and the notion that any phenomenon
comes into existence without a cause, is equivalent
to a belief in chance, which one may hope is, by this
time, finally exploded.</p>

<p>In the crayfish, at any rate, there is not the slightest
reason to doubt that every action has
its definite physical <span class="xxpn" id="p113">{113}</span>
cause, and that what it does at any moment would be
as clearly intelligible, if we only knew all the internal
and external conditions of the case, as the striking of a
clock is to any one who understands clockwork.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The adjustment of the body to varying external conditions,
which is one of the chief results of the working
of the nervous mechanism, would be far less important
from a physiological point of view than it is, if only
those external bodies which come into direct contact
with the organism<a class="afnanc" href="#fn9" id="fnanc9">9</a>
could affect it; though very delicate
influences of this kind take effect on the nervous apparatus
through the integument.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc9" id="fn9">9</a>
It may be said that, strictly speaking, only those external bodies
which are in direct contact with the organism do affect it—as the
vibrating ether, in the case of luminous bodies; the vibrating air or
water, in the case of sonorous bodies; odorous particles, in the case of
odorous bodies: but I have preferred the ordinary phraseology to a
pedantically accurate periphrasis.</p></div>

<p>It is probable that the <i>setæ</i>, or hairs, which
are so generally scattered over the body and the
appendages, are delicate tactile organs. They are
hollow processes of the chitinous cuticle, and their
cavities are continuous with narrow canals, which
traverse the whole thickness of the cuticle, and are
filled by a prolongation of the subjacent proper
integument. As this is supplied with nerves, it is
likely that fine nerve fibres reach the bases of
the hairs, and are affected by anything which stirs
these delicately poised levers. <span class="xxpn"
id="p114">{114}</span></p>

<p>There is much reason to believe that odorous bodies
affect crayfish; but it is very difficult to obtain experimental
evidence of the fact. However, there is a good
deal of analogical ground for the supposition that some
peculiar structures, which are evidently
of a sensory <span class="xxpn" id="p115">{115}</span>
nature, developed on the under side of the outer branch
of the antennule, play the part of an olfactory apparatus.</p>

<p>Both the outer (fig.
<a href="#f26" title="go to &#x66;ig. 26">26</a> A. <i>ex</i>) and the inner (<i>en</i>)
branches of the antennule are made up of a number of
delicate ring-like segments, which bear fine setæ (<i>b</i>) of
the ordinary character.</p>

<p>The inner branch, which is the shorter of the two, possesses
only these setæ; but the under surface of each of
the joints of the outer branch, from about the seventh or
eighth to the last but one, is provided with two bundles
of very curious appendages (fig.
<a href="#f27" title="go to &#x66;ig. 27">27</a>, A, B, C, <i>a</i>), one in
front and one behind. These are rather more than
1‐200th of an inch long, very delicate, and shaped like a
spatula, with a rounded handle and a flattened somewhat
curved blade, the end of which is sometimes truncated,
sometimes has the form of a prominent papilla. There
is a sort of joint between the handle and the blade, such
as is found between the basal and the terminal parts of
the ordinary setæ, with which, in fact, these processes
entirely correspond in their essential structure. A soft
granular tissue fills the interior of each of these problematical
structures, to which Leydig, their discoverer,
ascribes an olfactory function.</p>

<p>It is probable that the crayfish possesses something
analogous to taste, and a very likely seat for the organ
of this function is in the upper lip and the metastoma;
but if the organ exists it possesses no structural peculiarities
by which it
can be identified. <span class="xxpn" id="p116">{116}</span></p>

<p>There is no doubt, however, as to the special recipients
of sonorous and luminous vibrations; and these are of
particular importance, as they enable the nervous machinery
to be affected by bodies indefinitely remote
from it, and to change the place of the organism in
relation to such bodies.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Sonorous vibrations are enabled to act as the stimulants
of a special nerve (fig.
<a href="#f25" title="go to &#x66;ig. 25">25</a>, <i>a′n</i>) connected with the brain,
by means of the very curious <i>auditory sacs</i> (fig.
<a href="#f26" title="go to &#x66;ig. 26">26</a>, A, <i>au</i>)
which are lodged in the basal joints of the antennules.</p>

<p>Each of these joints is trihedral, the outer face being convex;
the inner, applied to its fellow, flat; and the upper,
on which the eyestalk rests, concave. On this upper face
there is a narrow elongated oval aperture, the outer lip of
which is beset with a flat brush of long close-set setæ,
which lie horizontally over the aperture, and effectually
close it. The aperture leads into a small sac (<i>au</i>) with
delicate walls formed by a chitinous continuation of the
general cuticula. The inferior and posterior wall of the
sac is raised up along a curved line into a ridge which
projects into its interior (fig.
<a href="#f27" title="go to &#x66;ig. 27">27</a>, A, <i>r</i>). Each side of this
ridge is beset with a series of delicate setæ (<i>as</i>), the
longest of which measures about 1‐50th of an inch; they
thus form a longitudinal band bent upon itself. These
<i>auditory setæ</i> project into the fluid contents of the sac,
and their apices are for the most part imbedded in a
gelatinous mass, which contains irregular
particles of sand <span class="xxpn" id="p117">{117}</span>
and sometimes of other foreign matter. A nerve (<i>n&#x202f;n′</i>,) is
distributed to the sac, and its fibres enter the bases of
the hairs, and may be traced to their apices, where they
end in peculiar elongated rod-like bodies (fig.
<a href="#f27" title="go to &#x66;ig. 27">27</a>, C).
Here is an auditory organ of the simplest description.
It retains, in fact, throughout life, the condition of a
simple sac or involution of the integument, such as is
that of the vertebrate ear in its earliest stage.</p>

<p>The sonorous vibrations transmitted through the
water in which the crayfish lives to the fluid and
solid contents of the auditory sac are taken up by
the delicate hairs of the ridge, and give rise to
molecular changes which traverse the auditory nerves
and reach the cerebral ganglia.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The vibrations of the luminiferous ether are brought
to bear upon the free ends of two large bundles of nerve
fibres, termed the optic nerves (fig.
<a href="#f25" title="go to &#x66;ig. 25">25</a>, <i>on</i>), which proceed
directly from the brain, by means of a highly complex <i>eye</i>.
This is an apparatus, which, in part, sorts out the rays of
light into as many very small pencils as there are separate
endings of the fibres of the optic nerve, and, in part,
serves as the medium by which the luminous vibrations
are converted into molecular nerve changes.</p>

<p>The free extremity of the eyestalk presents a convex,
soft, and transparent surface, limited by an oval contour.
The cuticle in this region, which is termed the <i>cornea</i>,
(fig.
<a href="#f28" title="go to &#x66;ig. 28">28</a>, <i>a</i>), is, in fact, somewhat thinner and less distinctly
laminated than in the rest of the eyestalk, and it
contains no calcareous matter. But it is directly continuous
with the rest of the exoskeleton of the eyestalk,
to which it stands in somewhat the same relation as the
soft integument of an articulation does to the adjacent
hard parts.</p>

<div class="dctr02" id="f28">

<i>f</i>, inner dark zone; <i>cr</i>, crystalline cones; <i>g</i>,
optic ganglion; <i>op</i>, optic nerve; <i>sp</i>, striated
spindles.</div></div>

<p>The <i>cornea</i> is divided into a great number of minute,
usually square facets, by faint lines, which cross
it from side <span class="xxpn" id="p119">{119}</span>
to side nearly at right angles with one another. A longitudinal
section shows that both the horizontal and the
vertical contours of the cornea are very nearly semicircular,
and that the lines which mark off the facets merely
arise from a slight modification of its substance between
the facets. The outer contour of each facet forms part
of the general curvature of the outer face of the cornea;
the inner contour sometimes exhibits
a slight deviation <span class="xxpn" id="p120">{120}</span>
from the general curvature of the inner face, but usually
nearly coincides with it.</p>

<p>When a longitudinal or a transverse section is taken
through the whole eyestalk, the optic nerve (fig.
<a href="#f28" title="go to &#x66;ig. 28">28</a>,
A, <i>op</i>) is seen to traverse its centre. At first narrow
and cylindrical, it expands towards its extremity into
a sort of bulb (B, <i>g</i>), the outer surface of which is curved
in correspondence with the inner surface of the cornea.
The terminal half of the bulb contains a great quantity
of dark colouring matter or pigment, and, in section,
appears as what may be termed the <i>inner dark zone</i> (<i>f</i>).
Outside this, and in connection with it, follows a white
line, the <i>inner white zone</i> (<i>e</i>), then comes a <i>middle dark
zone</i> (<i>d</i>); outside this an outer pale band, which may
be called the <i>outer white zone</i> (<i>c</i>), and between this and
the cornea (<i>a</i>) is another broad band of dark pigment, the
<i>outer dark zone</i> (<i>b</i>).</p>

<p>When viewed under a low power, by reflected light, this
outer dark zone is seen to be traversed by nearly parallel
straight lines, each of which starts from the boundary
between two facets, and can be followed inwards through
the outer white zone to the middle dark zone. Thus the
whole substance of the eye between the outer surface of
the bulb of the optic nerve and the inner surface of the
cornea is marked out into as many segments as the
cornea has facets; and each segment has the form
of a wedge or slender pyramid, the base of which is
four-sided, and is applied against the
inner surface of <span class="xxpn" id="p121">{121}</span>
one of the facets of the cornea, while its summit lies in
the middle dark zone. Each of these <i>visual pyramids</i>
consists of an axial structure, the <i>visual rod</i>, invested by
a sheath. The latter extends inwards from the margin
of each facet of the cornea, and contains pigment in
two regions of its length, the intermediate space being
devoid of pigment. As the position of the pigmented
regions in relation to the length of the pyramid is always
the same, the pigmented regions necessarily take the form
of two consecutive zones when the pyramids are in their
natural position.</p>

<p>The visual rod consists of two parts, an external
<i>crystalline cone</i> (fig.
<a href="#f28" title="go to &#x66;ig. 28">28</a>, B, <i>cr</i>), and an internal <i>striated
spindle</i> (<i>sp</i>). The <i>crystalline cone</i> consists of a transparent
glassy-looking substance, which may be made to
split up longitudinally into four segments. Its inner end
narrows into a filament which traverses the outer white
zone, and, in the middle dark zone, thickens into a four-sided
spindle-shaped transparent body, which appears
transversely striated. The inner end of this <i>striated
spindle</i> narrows again, and becomes continuous with
nerve fibres which proceed from the surface of the optic
bulb.</p>

<p>The exact mode of connection of the nerve-fibres with
the visual rods is not certainly made out, but it is probable
that there is direct continuity of substance, and that
each rod is really the termination of a nerve fibre.</p>

<p>Eyes having essentially the same structure
as that of <span class="xxpn" id="p122">{122}</span>
the crayfish are very widely met with among <i>Crustacea</i>
and <i>Insecta</i>, and are commonly known as <i>compound eyes</i>.
In many of these animals, in fact, when the cornea is removed,
each facet is found to act as a separate lens; and
when proper arrangements are made, as many distinct
pictures of external objects are found behind it as there
are facets. Hence the notion suggested itself that each
visual pyramid is a separate eye, similar in principle of
construction to the human eye, and forming a picture of
so much of the external world as comes within the range
of its lens, upon a retina supposed to be spread out on
the surface of the crystalline cone, as the human retina is
spread over the surface of the vitreous humour.</p>

<p>But, in the first place, there is no evidence, nor any
probability, that there is anything corresponding to a
retina on the outer face of the crystalline cone; and
secondly, if there were, it is incredible that, with such an
arrangement of the refractive media as exists in the
cornea and crystalline cones, rays proceeding from points
in the external world should be brought to a focus in correspondingly
related points of the surface of the supposed
retina. But without this no picture could be formed, and
no distinct vision could take place. It is very probable,
therefore, that the visual pyramids do not play the part
of the simple eyes of the <i>Vertebrata</i>, and the only alternative
appears to be the adoption of a modification of the
theory of <i>mosaic vision</i>, propounded many years by
Johannes Müller. <span class="xxpn" id="p123">{123}</span></p>

<p>Each visual pyramid, isolated from its fellows by its coat
of pigment, may be supposed, in fact, to play the part of a
very narrow straight tube, with blackened walls, one end
of which is turned towards the external world, while the
other incloses the extremity of one of the nerve fibres. The
only light which can reach the latter, under these circumstances,
is such as proceeds from points which lie in the
direction of a straight line represented by the produced
axis of the tubes.</p>

with the visual rods.</div></div>

<p>Suppose A–I to be nine such tubes, <i>a–i</i> the corresponding
nerve fibres, and <i>x</i> <i>y</i> <i>z</i> three points from which
light proceeds. Then it will be obvious that
the only light <span class="xxpn" id="p124">{124}</span>
from <i>x</i> which will excite sensation, will be the ray
which traverses <span class="smmaj">B</span> and reaches the nerve-fibre <i>b</i>,
while that from <i>y</i> will affect only <i>e</i>, and that from
<i>x</i> only <i>h</i>. The result, translated into sensation, will
be three points of light on a dark ground, each of which
answers to one of the luminous points, and indicates its
direction in reference to the eye and its angular distance
from the other two.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn10" id="fnanc10">10</a></p>

<p>The only modification needed in the original form of
the theory of mosaic vision, is the supposition that part,
or the whole, of the visual rod, is not merely a passive
transmitter of light to the nerve-fibre, but is, itself, in
someway concerned in transmuting the mode of motion,
light, into that other mode of motion which we call
nervous energy. The visual rod is, in fact, to be regarded
as the physiological end of the nerve, and the
instrument by which the conversion of the one form of
motion into the other takes place; just as the auditory
hairs are instruments by which the sonorous waves are
converted into molecular movements of the substance of
the auditory nerves.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc10" id="fn10">10</a>
Since the visual rods are strongly refracting solids, and not empty
tubes, the diagram given in fig.
<a href="#f29" title="go to &#x66;ig. 29">29</a> does not represent the true course of
the rays, indicated by dotted lines, which fall obliquely on any cornea
of a crayfish’s eye. Such rays will be more or less bent towards the
axis of the visual rod of that cornea; but whether they reach its apex
and so affect the nerve or not will depend on the curvature of the cornea;
its refractive index and that of the crystalline cone; and the relation
between the length and the thickness of the latter.</p></div>

<p>It is wonderfully interesting to observe that, when the
so-called compound eye is interpreted
in this manner, <span class="xxpn" id="p125">{125}</span>
the apparent wide difference between it and the vertebrate
eye gives place to a fundamental resemblance. The
rods and cones of the retina of the vertebrate eye are
extraordinarily similar in their form and their relations
to the fibres of the optic nerve, to the visual rods of the
arthropod eye. And the morphological discrepancy,
which is at first so striking, and which arises from the
fact that the free ends of the visual rods are turned
towards the light, while those of the rods and cones
of the vertebrate eye are turned from it, becomes a confirmation
of the parallel between the two when the development
of the vertebrate eye is taken into account. For it
is demonstrable that the deep surface of the retina in
which the rods and cones lie, is really a part of the outer
surface of the body turned inwards, in the course of the
singular developmental changes which give rise to the
brain and the eye of vertebrate animals.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Thus the crayfish has, at any rate, two of the higher
sense organs, the ear and the eye, which we possess ourselves;
and it may seem a superfluous, not to say a
frivolous, question, if any one should ask whether it can
hear and see.</p>

<p>But, in truth, the inquiry, if properly limited, is a very
pertinent one. That the crayfish is led by the use of its
eyes and ears to approach some objects and avoid others,
is beyond all doubt; and, in this sense, most indubitably
it can both hear and see. But
if the question <span class="xxpn" id="p126">{126}</span>
means, do luminous vibrations give it the sensations of
light and darkness, of colour and form and distance, which
they give to us&#x202f;? and do sonorous vibrations produce the
feelings of noise and tone, of melody and of harmony, as
in us&#x202f;?—it is by no means to be answered hastily, perhaps
cannot be answered at all, except in a tentative, probable
way.</p>

<p>The phenomena to which we give the names of sound
and colour are not physical things, but are states of consciousness,
dependent, there is every reason to believe,
on the functional activity of certain parts of our brains.
Melody and harmony are names for states of consciousness
which arise when at least two sensations of sound
have been produced.  All these are manufactured articles,
products of the human brain; and it would be
exceedingly hazardous to affirm that organs capable of
giving rise to the same products exist in the vastly
simpler nervous system of the crustacean. It would be
the height of absurdity to expect from a meat-jack the
sort of work which is performed by a Jacquard loom; and
it appears to me to be little less preposterous to look for
the production of anything analogous to the more subtle
phenomena of the human mind in something so minute
and rude in comparison to the human brain, as the
insignificant cerebral ganglia of the crayfish.</p>

<p>At the most, one may be justified in supposing the
existence of something approaching dull feeling in ourselves;
and, to return to the problem
stated in the <span class="xxpn" id="p127">{127}</span>
beginning of this chapter, so far as such obscure consciousness
accompanies the molecular changes of its nervous substance,
it will be right to speak of the mind of a crayfish.
But it will be obvious that it is merely putting the cart
before the horse, to speak of such a mind as a factor
in the work done by the organism, when it is merely a
dim symbol of a part of such work in the doing.</p>

<p>Whether the crayfish possesses consciousness or not,
however, does not affect the question of its being an
engine, the actions of which at any moment depend, on
the one hand, upon the series of molecular changes excited,
either by internal or by external causes, in its neuro-muscular
machinery; and, on the other, upon the disposition
and the properties of the parts of that machinery.
And such a self-adjusting machine, containing the immediate
conditions of its action within itself, is what is
properly understood by an automaton.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Crayfishes, as we have seen, may attain a considerable
age; and there is no means of knowing how long they
might live, if protected from the innumerable destructive
influences to which they are at all ages liable.</p>

<p>It is a widely received notion that the energies of living
matter have a natural tendency to decline, and finally
disappear; and that the death of the body, as a whole,
is the necessary correlate of its life. That all living
things sooner or later perish needs no demonstration,
but it would be difficult to
find satisfactory grounds <span class="xxpn" id="p128">{128}</span>
for the belief that they must needs do so. The analogy of
a machine that, sooner or later, must be brought to a
standstill by the wear and tear of its parts, does not
hold, inasmuch as the animal mechanism is continually
renewed and repaired; and, though it is true that individual
components of the body are constantly dying, yet
their places are taken by vigorous successors. A city
remains, notwithstanding the constant death-rate of its
inhabitants; and such an organism as a crayfish is only
a corporate unity, made up of innumerable partially
independent individualities.</p>

<p>Whatever might be the longevity of crayfishes under
imaginable perfect conditions, the fact that, notwithstanding
the great number of eggs they produce, their number
remains pretty much the same in a given district, if
we take the average of a period of years, shows that
about as many die as are born; and that, without the
process of reproduction, the species would soon come to
an end.</p>

<p>There are many examples among members of the group
of <i>Crustacea</i> to which the crayfish belongs, of animals which
produce young from internally developed germs, as some
plants throw off bulbs which are capable of reproducing
the parent stock; such is the case, for example, with the
common water flea (<i>Daphnia</i>). But nothing of this kind
has been observed in the crayfish; in which, as in the
higher animals, the reproduction of the species is dependent
upon the combination of two
kinds of living <span class="xxpn" id="p129">{129}</span>
matter, which are developed in different individuals,
termed <i>males</i> and <i>females</i>.</p>

<p>These two kinds of living matter are <i>ova</i> and <i>spermatozoa</i>,
and they are developed in special organs, the <i>ovary</i>
and the <i>testis</i>. The ovary is lodged in the female; the
testis, in the male.</p>

<p>The <i>ovary</i> (fig.
<a href="#f30" title="go to &#x66;ig. 30">30</a>, <i>ov</i>) is a body of a trefoil form,
which is situated immediately beneath, or in front of,
the heart, between the floor of the pericardial sinus and
the alimentary canal. From the ventral face of this
organ two short and wide canals, the <i>oviducts</i> (<i>od</i>), lead
down to the bases of the second pair of walking limbs,
and terminate in the apertures (<i>od′</i>) already noticed
there.</p>

<p>The <i>testis</i> (fig.
<a href="#f31" title="go to &#x66;ig. 31">31</a>, <i>t</i>) is somewhat similar in form to
the ovary, but, the three divisions
are much narrower <span class="xxpn" id="p130">{130}</span>
and more elongated: the hinder median division lies
under the heart; the anterior divisions are situated
between the heart behind, and the stomach and the liver
in front (figs. <a href="#f05" title="go to &#x66;ig. 5">5</a> and
<a href="#f12" title="go to &#x66;ig. ">12</a>, <i>t</i>). From the point at which the
three divisions join, proceed two ducts, which are termed
the <i>vasa deferentia</i> (fig.
<a href="#f31" title="go to &#x66;ig. 31">31</a>, <i>vd</i>). These are very narrow,
long, and make many coils before they reach the apertures
upon the bases of the hindermost pair of walking limbs, by
which they open externally (fig.
<a href="#f31" title="go to &#x66;ig. 31">31</a>, <i>vd′</i>, and fig.
<a href="#f35" title="go to &#x66;ig. 35">35</a>, <i>vd</i>).
Both the ovary and the testis are
very much larger <span class="xxpn" id="p131">{131}</span>
during the breeding season than at other times; the large
brownish-yellow eggs become conspicuous in the ovary,
and the testis assumes a milk-white colour, at this
period.</p>

globular nucleus <i>n</i>; <i>b</i>, with a spindle-shaped nucleus;
<i>c</i>, with two similar nuclei; and <i>d</i>, with a nucleus
undergoing division (×&#x202f;600).</div></div>

<p>The walls of the ovary are lined internally by
a layer of <span class="xxpn" id="p132">{132}</span>
nucleated cells, separated from the cavity of the organ by
a delicate structureless membrane. The growth of these
cells gives rise to papillary elevations which project into
the cavity of the ovary, and eventually become globular
bodies attached by short stalks, and invested by the structureless
membrane as a <i>membrana propria</i> (fig.
<a href="#f32" title="go to &#x66;ig. 32">32</a>, <i>m</i>).
These are the <i>ovisacs</i>. In the mass of cells which becomes
the ovisac, one rapidly increases in size and
occupies the centre of the ovisac,
while the others <span class="xxpn" id="p133">{133}</span>
surround it as a peripheral coat (<i>ep.</i>). This central cell
is the <i>ovum</i>. Its nucleus enlarges, and becomes what is
called the <i>germinal vesicle</i> (<i>g.v.</i>). At the same time
numerous small corpuscles, flattened externally and
convex internally, appear in it and are the <i>germinal
spots</i> (<i>g.s.</i>). The protoplasm of the cell, as it enlarges,
becomes granular and opaque, assumes a deep brownish-yellow
colour, and is thus converted into the <i>yelk</i> or
<i>vitellus</i> (<i>v.</i>). As the egg grows, a structureless <i>vitelline
membrane</i> is formed between the vitellus and the cells
which line the ovisac, and incloses the egg, as in a
bag. Finally, the ovisac bursts, and the egg, falling
into the cavity of the ovary, makes its way down the
oviduct, and sooner or later passes out by its aperture.
When they leave the oviduct, the ova are invested by
a viscous, transparent substance, which attaches them
to the swimmerets of the female, and then sets; thus
each egg, inclosed in a tough case, is firmly suspended
by a stalk, which, on the one side, is continued into the
substance of the case, while, on the other, it is fixed to
the swimmeret. The swimmerets are kept constantly in
motion, so that the eggs are well supplied with aërated
water. <span class="xxpn" id="p134">{134}</span></p>

<p>The testis consists of an immense number of minute
spheroidal vesicles (fig.
<a href="#f33" title="go to &#x66;ig. 33">33</a>, A, <i>a</i>), attached like grapes to
the ends of short stalks (<i>b</i>), formed by the ultimate
ramifications of the vasa deferentia. The vesicles may,
in fact, be regarded as dilatations of the
ends and sides <span class="xxpn" id="p135">{135}</span>
of the finest branches of the ducts of the testis. The
cavity of each vesicle is filled by the large nucleated cells
which line its walls (fig.
<a href="#f33" title="go to &#x66;ig. 33">33</a>, B), and, as the breeding
season approaches, these cells multiply by division.
Finally, they undergo some very singular changes of
form and internal structure (fig.
<a href="#f34" title="go to &#x66;ig. 34">34</a>, A–D), each becoming
converted into a flattened spheroidal body, about
1‐1700th of an inch diameter, provided with a number
of slender curved rays, which stand out from its sides
(fig.
<a href="#f34" title="go to &#x66;ig. 34">34</a>, E–G). These are the <i>spermatozoa</i>.</p>

<p>The spermatozoa accumulate in the testicular vesicles,
and give rise to a milky-looking substance, which traverses
the smaller ducts, and eventually fills the vasa deferentia.
This substance, however, consists, in addition to the
spermatozoa, of a viscid material, secreted by the walls
of the vasa deferentia, which envelopes the spermatozoa,
and gives the secretion of the testis the form and the
consistency of threads of vermicelli.</p>

<p>The ripening and detachment of both the ova and
the spermatozoa take place immediately after the completion
of ecdysis in the early autumn; and at this
time, which is the breeding season, the males seek
the females with great avidity, in order to deposit the
fertilizing matter contained in the vasa deferentia on the
sterna of their hinder thoracic and anterior abdominal
somites. There it adheres as a whitish, chalky-looking
mass; but the manner in which the contained spermatozoa
reach and enter the ova is
unknown. The analogy <span class="xxpn" id="p136">{136}</span>
of what occurs in other animals, however, leaves no doubt
that an actual mixture of the male and female elements
takes place and constitutes the essential part of
the process of impregnation.</p>

<p>Ova to which spermatozoa have had no access,
give rise to no progeny; but, in the impregnated ovum,
the young crayfish takes its origin in a manner to be
described below, when the question of development is
dealt with.</p>

<span class="hsmall">
THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE COM­MON CRAY­FISH: THE STRUC­TURE
AND THE DE­VEL­OP­MENT OF THE IN­DI­VI­DUAL.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">In the two preceding chapters the crayfish has been
studied from the point of view of the physiologist, who,
regarding an animal as a mechanism, endeavours to discover
how it does that which it does. And, practically, this
way of looking at the matter is the same as that of the
teleologist. For, if all that we know concerning the purpose
of a mechanism is derived from observation of the
manner in which it acts, it is all one, whether we say
that the properties and the connexions of its parts
account for its actions, or that its structure is adapted
to the performance of those actions.</p>

<p>Hence it necessarily follows that physiological phenomena
can be expressed in the language of teleology.
On the assumption that the preservation of the individual,
and the continuance of the species, are the
final causes of the organization of an animal, the existence
of that organization is, in a certain sense, explained,
when it is shown that it is fitted for the attainment of
those ends; although, perhaps,
the importance of <span class="xxpn" id="p138">{138}</span>
demonstrating the proposition that a thing is fitted to do
that which it does, is not very great.</p>

<p>But whatever may be the value of teleological explanations,
there is a large series of facts, which have as
yet been passed over, or touched only incidentally, of
which they take no account. These constitute the subject
matter of <i>Morphology</i>, which is related to physiology
much as, in the not-living world, crystallography is
related to the study of the chemical and physical properties
of minerals.</p>

<p>Carbonate of lime, for example, is a definite compound
of calcium, carbon, and oxygen, and it has a great variety
of physical and chemical properties. But it may be
studied under another aspect, as a substance capable of
assuming crystalline forms, which, though extraordinarily
various, may all be reduced to certain geometrical types.
It is the business of the crystallographer to work out
the relations of these forms; and, in so doing, he takes no
note of the other properties of carbonate of lime.</p>

<p>In like manner, the morphologist directs his attention
to the relations of form between different parts of the
same animal, and between different animals; and these
relations would be unchanged if animals were mere
dead matter, devoid of all physiological properties—a
kind of mineral capable of a peculiar mode of growth.</p>

<p>A familiar exemplification of the difference
between teleology and morphology may be found in such
works of human art as houses. <span class="xxpn"
id="p139">{139}</span></p>

<p>A house is certainly, to a great extent, an illustration
of adaptation to purpose, and its structure is, to that
extent, explicable by teleological reasonings. The roof
and the walls are intended to keep out the weather; the
foundation is meant to afford support and to exclude
damp; one room is contrived for the purpose of a
kitchen; another for that of a coal-cellar; a third for
that of a dining-room; others are constructed to serve as
sleeping rooms, and so on; doors, chimneys, windows,
drains, are all more or less elaborate contrivances directed
towards one end, the comfort and health of the dwellers
in the house. What is sometimes called sanitary architecture,
now-a-days, is based upon considerations of house
teleology. But though all houses are, to begin with and
essentially, means adapted to the ends of shelter and
comfort, they may be, and too often are, dealt with from
a point of view, in which adaptation to purpose is largely
disregarded, and the chief attention of the architect is
given to the form of the house. A house may be built in
the Gothic, the Italian, or the Queen Anne style; and a
house in any one of these styles of architecture may be
just as convenient or inconvenient, just as well or as ill
adapted to the wants of the resident therein, as any of
the others. Yet the three are exceedingly different.</p>

<p>To apply all this to the crayfish. It is, in a sense
a house with a great variety of rooms and offices, in
which the work of the indwelling life in feeding, breathing,
moving, and reproducing itself, is
done. But the <span class="xxpn" id="p140">{140}</span>
same may be said of the crayfish’s neighbours, the perch
and the water-snail; and they do all these things neither
better nor worse, in relation to the conditions of their
existence, than the crayfish does. Yet the most cursory
inspection is sufficient to show that the “styles of architecture”
of the three are even more widely different than
are those of the Gothic, Italian, and Queen Anne houses.</p>

<p>That which Architecture, as an art conversant with
pure form, is to buildings, Morphology, as a science
conversant with pure form, is to animals and plants.
And we may now proceed to occupy ourselves exclusively
with the morphological aspect of the crayfish.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>As I have already mentioned, when dealing with the
physiology of the crayfish, the entire body of the animal,
when reduced to its simplest morphological expression,
may be represented as a cylinder, closed at each end, except
so far as it is perforated by the alimentary apertures
(fig.
<a href="#f06" title="go to &#x66;ig. 6">6</a>); or we may say that it is a tube, inclosing
another tube, the edges of the two being continuous at
their extremities. The outer tube has a chitinous outer
coat or cuticle, which is continued on to the inner face
of the inner tube. Neglecting this for the present, the
outermost part of the wall of the outer tube, which
answers to the <i>epidermis</i> of the higher animals, and the
innermost part of the wall of the inner tube, which is
an <i>epithelium</i>, are formed by a layer of nucleated cells.
A continuous layer of cells, therefore,
is everywhere to <span class="xxpn" id="p141">{141}</span>
be found on both the external and the internal free surfaces
of the body. So far as these cells belong to the
proper external wall of the body, they constitute the
<i>ectoderm</i>, and so far as they belong to its proper internal
wall, they compose the <i>endoderm</i>. Between these two
layers of nucleated cells lie all the other parts of the
body, composed of connective tissue, muscles, vessels,
and nerves; and all these (with the exception of the
ganglionic chain, which we shall see properly belongs to
the ectoderm) may be regarded as a single thick stratum,
which, as it lies between the ectoderm and the endoderm,
is called the <i>mesoderm</i>.</p>

<p>If the intestine were closed posteriorly instead of
opening by the vent, the crayfish would virtually be an
elongated sac, with one opening, the mouth, affording an
entrance into the alimentary cavity: and, round this
cavity, the three layers just referred to—endoderm,
mesoderm, and ectoderm—would be disposed concentrically.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>We have seen that the body of the crayfish thus composed
is obviously separable into three regions—the
<i>cephalon</i> or head, the <i>thorax</i>, and the <i>abdomen</i>. The
latter is at once distinguished by the size and the
mobility of its segments: while the thoracic region is
marked off from that of the head, outwardly, only by the
cervical groove. But, when the carapace is removed,
the lateral depression already mentioned,
in which the <span class="xxpn" id="p142">{142}</span>
scaphognathite lies, clearly indicates the natural boundary
between the head and the thorax. It has further been
observed that there are, in all, twenty pairs of appendages,
the six hindermost of which are attached to
the abdomen. If the other fourteen pairs are carefully
removed, it will be found that the six anterior belong to
the head, and the eight posterior to the thorax.</p>

<p>The abdominal region may now be studied in further
detail. Each of its seven movable segments, except the
telson, represents a sort of morphological unit, the repetition
of which makes up the whole fabric of the body.</p>

<p>If the abdomen is divided
transversely between the <span class="xxpn" id="p143">{143}</span>
fourth and fifth, and the fifth and sixth segments, the fifth
will be isolated, and can be studied apart. It constitutes
what is called a <i>metamere</i>; in which are distinguishable a
central part termed the <i>somite</i>, and two <i>appendages</i>
(fig.
<a href="#f36" title="go to &#x66;ig. 36">36</a>).</p>

<p>In the exoskeleton of the somites of the abdomen several
regions have already been distinguished; and although they
constitute one continuous whole, it will be convenient to
speak of the <i>sternum</i> (fig.
<a href="#f36" title="go to &#x66;ig. 36">36</a>, <i>st. XIX</i>), the <i>tergum</i>
(<i>t. XIX</i>), and, the <i>pleura</i> (<i>pl. XIX</i>), as if they were
separate parts, and to distinguish that portion of the
sternal region, which lies between the articulation of the
appendage and the pleuron, on each side, as the <i>epimeron</i>
(<i>ep. XIX</i>). Adopting this nomenclature, it may be said
of the fifth somite of the abdomen, that it consists of
a segment of the exoskeleton, divisible into tergum,
pleura, epimera, and sternum, with which two appendages are
articulated; that it contains a double ganglion (<i>gn.</i> 12),
a section of the flexor (<i>fm</i>) and extensor (<i>em</i>) muscles,
and of the alimentary (<i>hg</i>) and vascular (<i>s.a.a</i>,

basipodite; <i>cx.p.</i>, coxopodite; <i>en.p.</i>, endopodite;
<i>ex.p.</i>, exopodite.</div></div>

<p>The appendage (fig.
<a href="#f36" title="go to &#x66;ig. 36">36</a>, <i>19</i>), which is attached to an
articular cavity situated between the sternum and the
epimeron, is seen to consist of a stalk or stem, which is
made up of a very short basal joint, the <i>coxopodite</i> (fig.
<a href="#f37" title="go to &#x66;ig. 37">37</a>, D and E, <i>cx.p</i>), followed by a long cylindrical second
joint, the <i>basipodite</i> (<i>b.p</i>), and receives the name of
<i>protopodite</i>. At its free end, it bears two flattened
narrow <span class="xxpn" id="p145">{145}</span>
plates, of which one is attached to the inner side of the
extremity of the protopodite, and is called the <i>endopodite</i>
(<i>en.p</i>), while the other is fixed a little higher up to the
outer side of that extremity, and is the <i>exopodite</i> (<i>ex.p</i>).
The exopodite is shorter than the endopodite. The
endopodite is broad and is undivided for about half its
length, from the attached end; the other half is narrower
and is divided into a number of small segments, which,
however, are not united by definite articulations, but are
merely marked off from one another by slight constrictions
of the exoskeleton. The exopodite has a similar
structure, but its undivided portion is shorter and narrower.
The edges of both the exopodite and the endopodite
are fringed with long setæ.</p>

<p>In the female crayfish, the appendages of this and of
the fourth and third somites are larger than in the male
(compare <i>D</i> and <i>E</i>, fig.
<a href="#f37" title="go to &#x66;ig. 37">37</a>).</p>

<p>The fourth and fifth somites, with their appendages,
may be described in the same terms as the third, and
in the sixth there is no difficulty in recognising the
corresponding parts of the somite; but the appendages
(fig.
<a href="#f37" title="go to &#x66;ig. 37">37</a>, <i>F</i>), which constitute the lateral portions of
the caudal fin, at first sight appear very different. In
their size, no less than in their appearance, they depart
widely from the appendages of the preceding somites.
Nevertheless, each will be found to consist of a basal
stalk, answering to the protopodite (<i>cx.p</i>), which however
is very broad and thick, and is not
divided into two <span class="xxpn" id="p146">{146}</span>
joints; and of two terminal oval plates, which represent
the endopodite (<i>en.p</i>) and the exopodite (<i>ex.p</i>). The
latter is divided by a transverse suture into two pieces;
and the edge of the larger or basal moiety is beset with
short spines, of which two, at the outer end of the series,
are larger than the rest.</p>

<p>The second somite is longer than the first (fig.
<a href="#f01" title="go to &#x66;ig. 1">1</a>); it
has very broad pleura, while those of the first somite are
small and hidden by the overlapping front margins of the
pleura of the second somite.</p>

<p>In the female, the appendages of the second somite of
the abdomen are similar to those of the third, fourth, and
fifth somites; but in those of the first somite (fig.
<a href="#f37" title="go to &#x66;ig. 37">37</a>, <i>B</i>),
there is a considerable variation. Sometimes, in fact,
the appendages of this somite are altogether wanting;
sometimes one is present, and not the other; and
sometimes both are found. But, when they exist, these
appendages are always small; and the protopodite is
followed by only one imperfectly jointed filament, which
appears to represent the endopodite of the other appendages.</p>

<p>In the male, the appendages of the first and second
somites of the abdomen are not only of relatively large
size, but they are widely different from the rest, those of
the first somite departing from the general type further
than those of the second. In the latter (<i>C, C′</i>) there is
a protopodite (<i>cx.p</i>, <i>bp</i>) with the ordinary structure, and
it is followed by an endopodite (<i>en.p</i>)
and an exopodite <span class="xxpn" id="p147">{147}</span>
(<i>ex.p</i>); but the former is singularly modified. The undivided
basal part is large, and is produced on the
inner side into a lamella (<i>a</i>), which extends slightly
beyond the end of the terminal jointed portion (<i>b</i>). The
inner half of this lamella is rolled upon itself, in such a
manner as to give rise to a hollow cone, something like
an extinguisher (<i>C′</i>, <i>a</i>).</p>

<p>The appendage of the first somite (<i>A</i>) is an unjointed
styliform body, which appears to represent the protopodite,
together with the basal part and the inner prolongation
of the endopodite of the preceding appendage.
The terminal half of the appendage is really a broad
plate, slightly bifid at the summit, but the sides of the
plate are rolled in, in such a manner that the anterior
half bends round and partially incloses the posterior half.
They thus give rise to a canal, which is open at each end,
and only partially closed behind.</p>

<p>These two pairs of curiously modified appendages are
ordinarily turned forwards and applied against the sterna
of the posterior part of the thorax, in the interval between
the bases of the hinder thoracic limbs (see fig.
<a href="#f03" title="go to &#x66;ig. 3">3</a>,
<i>A</i>). They serve as conduits by which the spermatic
matter of the male is conveyed from the openings of the
ducts of the testes to its destination.</p>

<p>If we confine our attention to the third, fourth, and
fifth metameres of the abdomen of the crayfish, it is
obvious that the several somites and their appendages,
and the various regions or parts into
which they are <span class="xxpn" id="p148">{148}</span>
divisible, correspond with one another, not only in form,
but in their relations to the general plan of the whole
abdomen. Or, in other words, a diagrammatic plan of
one somite will serve for all the three somites, with
insignificant variations in detail. The assertion that
these somites are constructed upon the same plan, involves
no more hypothesis than the statement of an
architect, that three houses are built upon the same plan,
though the façades and the internal decorations may
differ more or less.</p>

<p>In the language of morphology, such conformity in the
plan of organisation is termed <i>homology</i>. Hence, the
several metameres in question and their appendages, are
<i>homologous</i> with one another; while the regions of the
somites, and the parts of their appendages, are also
<i>homologues</i>.</p>

<p>When the comparison is extended to the sixth metamere,
the homology of the different parts with those of the
other metameres, is undeniable, notwithstanding the great
differences which they present. To recur to a previous
comparison, the ground plan of the building is the same,
though the proportions are varied. So with regard to
the first and second metameres. In the second pair
of appendages of the male, the difference from the
ordinary type of appendage is comparable to that produced
by adding a portico or a turret to the building;
while, in the first pair of appendages of the female,
it is as if one wing of the edifice
were left unbuilt; <span class="xxpn" id="p149">{149}</span>
and, in those of the male, as if all the rooms were run
into one.</p>

<p>It is further to be remarked, that, just as of a row of
houses built upon the same plan, one may be arranged so as
to serve as a dwelling-house, another as a warehouse, and
another as a lecture hall, so the homologous appendages
of the crayfish are made to subserve various functions.
And as the fitness of the dwelling-house, the warehouse,
and the lecture-hall for their several purposes would not
in the least help us to understand why they should all be
built upon the same general plan; so, the adaptation of
the appendages of the abdomen of the crayfish to the discharge
of their several functions does not explain why
those parts are homologous. On the contrary, it would
seem simpler that each part should have been constructed
in such a manner as to perform its allotted function in
the best possible manner, without reference to the rest.
The proceedings of an architect, who insisted on constructing
every building in a town on the plan of a
Gothic cathedral, would not be explicable by considerations
of fitness or convenience.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In the cephalothorax, the division into somites is not
at first obvious, for, as we have seen, the dorsal or tergal
surface is covered over by a continuous shield, distinguished
into thoracic and cephalic regions only by the
cervical groove. Even here, however, when a transverse
section of the thorax is compared with
that of the <span class="xxpn" id="p150">{150}</span>
abdomen (figs.
<a href="#f15" title="go to &#x66;ig. 15">15</a> and
<a href="#f36" title="go to &#x66;ig. 36">36</a>), it will be obvious that the tergal
and the sternal regions of the two answer to one another;
while the branchiostegites correspond with greatly developed
pleura; and the inner wall of the branchial
chamber, which extends from the bases of the appendages
to the attachment of the branchiostegite, represents an
immensely enlarged epimeral region.</p>

<p>On examination of the sternal aspect of the cephalothorax
the signs of division into somites become plain
(figs.
<a href="#f03" title="go to &#x66;ig. 3">3</a> and
<a href="#f39" title="go to &#x66;ig. 39">39</a>, <i>A</i>). Between the last two ambulatory
limbs there is an easily recognisable sternum (<i>XIV.</i>),
though it is considerably narrower than any of the
sterna of the abdominal somites, and differs from them
in shape.</p>

<p>The deep transverse fold which separates this hindermost
thoracic sternum from the rest of the sternal wall
of the cephalothorax, is continued upwards on the inner
or epimeral wall of the branchial cavity; and thus the
sternal and the epimeral portions of the posterior thoracic
somite are naturally marked off from those of the more
anterior somites.</p>

the first abdominal somite.</div></div>

<p>The epimeral region of this somite presents a very
curious structure (fig.
<a href="#f38" title="go to &#x66;ig. 38">38</a>). Immediately above the articular
cavities for the appendages there is a shield-shaped
plate, the posterior, convex edge of which is
sharp, prominent, and setose. Close to its upper
boundary the plate exhibits a round perforation (<i>plb.</i>),
to the margins of which the stem
of the hindermost <span class="xxpn" id="p151">{151}</span>
pleurobranchia (fig.
<a href="#f04" title="go to &#x66;ig. 4">4</a>, <i>plb. 14</i>) is attached; and in
front of this, it is connected, by a narrow neck, with
an elongated triangular piece, which takes a vertical
direction, and lies in the fold which separates the posterior
thoracic somite from the next in front. The base of this
piece unites with the epimeron of the penultimate somite.
Its apex is connected with the anterior end of the horizontal
arm of an L-shaped calcified bar (fig.
<a href="#f38" title="go to &#x66;ig. 38">38</a>, <i>a</i>), the upper end
of the vertical arm of which is firmly, but moveably, connected
with the anterior and lateral edge of the tergum
of the first abdominal somite (<i>t. XV.</i>). The
tendon of one <span class="xxpn" id="p152">{152}</span>
of the large extensor muscles of the abdomen is attached
close to it.</p>

<p>The sternum and the shield-shaped epimeral plates
constitute a solid, continuously calcified, ventral element
of the skeleton, to which the posterior pair of legs is
attached; and as this structure is united with the
somites in front of and behind it only by soft cuticle,
except where the shield-shaped plate is connected, by
the intermediation of the triangular piece, with the
epimeron which lies in front of it, it is freely movable
backwards and forwards on the imperfect hinge thus
constituted.</p>

<p>In the same way, the first somite of the abdomen,
and, consequently, the abdomen as a whole, moves upon
the hinges formed by the union of the L-shaped pieces
with the triangular pieces.</p>

<p>In the rest of the thorax, the sternal and the epimeral
regions of the several somites are all firmly united
together. Nevertheless, shallow grooves answering to
folds of the cuticle, which run from the intervals
between the articular cavities for the limbs towards the
tergal end of the inner wall of the branchial chamber,
mark off the epimeral portions of as many somites as
there are sterna, from one another.</p>

cephalothoracic appendages. (The anterior cephalic
sterna are bent downwards in A so as to bring them
into the same plane with the remaining cephalothoracic
sterna; in B these sterna are not shown.)</div></div>

<p>A short distance above the articular cavities a transverse
groove separates a nearly square area of the lower
part of the epimeron from the rest. Towards the
anterior and upper angle of this area, in
the two somites <span class="xxpn" id="p153">{153}</span>
which lie immediately in front of the hindermost, there
is a small round aperture for the
attachment of the <span class="xxpn" id="p154">{154}</span>
rudimentary branchia. These areæ of the epimera, in
fact, correspond with the shield-shaped plate of the
hindermost somite. In the next most anterior somite
(that which bears the first pair of ambulatory legs) there
is only a small elevation in the place of the rudimentary
branchia; and in the anterior four thoracic somites nothing
of the kind is visible.</p>

<p>On the sternal aspect of the thorax (figs.
<a href="#f03" title="go to &#x66;ig. 3">3</a> and
<a href="#f39" title="go to &#x66;ig. 39">39</a>, A) a
triangular space is interposed between the basal joints or
coxopodites of the penultimate and the ante-penultimate
pairs of ambulatory legs, while the coxopodites of the
more anterior limbs are closely approximated. The
triangular area in question is occupied by two sterna
(fig.
<a href="#f39" title="go to &#x66;ig. 39">39</a>, A, <i>XII</i>, <i>XIII</i>), the lateral margins of which are
raised into flange-like ridges. The next two sterna (<i>X</i>,
<i>XI</i>) are longer, especially that which lies between the
forceps (<i>X</i>), but they are very narrow; while the lateral
processes are reduced to mere tubercles at the posterior
ends of the sterna. Between the three pairs of maxillipedes,
the sterna (<i>VII</i>, <i>VIII</i>, <i>IX</i>) are yet narrower, and
become gradually shorter; but traces of the tubercles at
their posterior ends are still discernible. The most
anterior of these sternal rods passes into a transversely
elongated plate, shaped like a broad arrow (<i>V</i>, <i>VI</i>),
which is constituted by the conjoined sterna of the two
posterior somites of the head.</p>

<p>Anteriorly to this, and between it and the posterior
end of the elongated oral aperture, the
sternal region is <span class="xxpn" id="p155">{155}</span>
occupied only by soft or imperfectly calcified cuticle,
which, on each side of the hinder part of the mouth,
passes into one of the lobes of the metastoma (<i>mt</i>). At
the base of each of these lobes there is a calcified plate,
united by an oblique suture with another, which occupies
the whole length of the lobe and gives it firmness. The
soft narrow lip which constitutes the lateral boundary
of the oral aperture, and lies between it and the mandible,
passes, in front, into the posterior face of the
labrum (<i>lb</i>).</p>

<p>In front of the mouth, the sternal region which appertains,
in part, to the antennæ, and, in part, to the mandibles,
is obvious as a broad plate (<i>III</i>), termed the
<i>epistoma</i>. The middle third of the posterior edge of the
epistoma gives rise to a thickened transverse ridge, with
rounded ends, slightly excavated behind, and is then
continued into the labrum (<i>lb</i>), which is strengthened by
three pairs of calcifications, arranged in a longitudinal
series. The sides of the front edge of the epistoma are
excavated, and bound the articular cavities for the basal
joints of the antennæ (<i>3</i>); but, in the middle line, the
epistoma is continued forwards into a spear-head shaped
process (figs.
<a href="#f39" title="go to &#x66;ig. 39">39</a> and
<a href="#f40" title="go to &#x66;ig. 40">40</a>, <i>II</i>), to which the posterior end of
the antennulary sternum contributes. The antennulary
sternum is very narrow, and its anterior or upper end runs
into a small but distinct conical median spine (fig.
<a href="#f40" title="go to &#x66;ig. 40">40</a>, <i>t.</i>).
Upon this follows an uncalcified plate, bent into the form of
a half cylinder (<i>I</i>), which lies between the
inner ends of <span class="xxpn" id="p156">{156}</span>
the eye-stalks and is united with adjacent parts only
by flexible cuticle, so that it is freely movable. This
represents the whole of the sternal region, and probably
more, of the ophthalmic somite.</p>

<p>The sterna of fourteen somites are thus identifiable in
the cephalothorax. The corresponding epimera are
represented, in the thorax, by the thin inner walls of the
branchial chamber; the pleura, by the branchiostegites;
and the terga, by so much of the median region of the
carapace as lies behind the cervical groove. That part of
the carapace which is situated in front of this groove occupies
the place of the terga of the head; while the low
ridge, skirting the oral and præ-oral region, in which it
terminates laterally, represents the pleura of the cephalic
somites.</p>

<p>The epimera of the head are, for the most part, very
narrow; but those of the antennulary somite are broad
plates (fig.
<a href="#f40" title="go to &#x66;ig. 40">40</a>, <i>epm.</i>), which
constitute the posterior <span class="xxpn" id="p157">{157}</span>
wall of the orbits. I am inclined to think that a transverse
ridge, which unites these under the base of the
rostrum, represents the tergum of the antennulary somite,
and that the rostrum itself belongs to the next or
antennary somite.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn11" id="fnanc11">11</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc11" id="fn11">11</a>
There are some singular marine crustacea,
the <i>Squillidæ</i>, in which both the ophthalmic and the
antennary somites are free and movable, while the rostrum
is articulated with the tergum of the antennary somite.</p></div>

<p>The sharp convex ventral edge of the rostrum (fig.
<a href="#f41" title="go to &#x66;ig. 41">41</a>)
is produced into a single, or sometimes two divergent
spines, which descend, in front of the ophthalmic somite,
towards the conical tubercle mentioned above: it thus
gives rise to an imperfect partition between the orbits.</p>

<p>The internal face of the sternal wall of the whole of
the thorax and of the post-oral part of the head, presents
a complicated arrangement of hard parts, which is known
as the <i>endophragmal system</i> (figs.
<a href="#f39" title="go to &#x66;ig. 39">39</a>, <i>B</i>,
<a href="#f42" title="go to &#x66;ig. 42">42</a>, and
<a href="#f43" title="go to &#x66;ig. 43">43</a>), and
which performs the office of an internal skeleton by affording
attachment to muscles, and serving to protect important
viscera, while at the same time it ties the somites
together, and unites them into a solid whole. In reality,
however, the curious pillars and bulkheads which enter
into the composition of the endophragmal
system are all <span class="xxpn" id="p158">{158}</span>
mere infoldings of the cuticle, or <i>apodemes</i>; and, as such,
they are shed along with the other cuticular structures
during the process of ecdysis.</p>

<p>Without entering into unnecessary details, the general
principle of the construction of the endophragmal
skeleton may be stated as follows. Four apodemes are
developed between every two somites, and as every
apodeme is a fold of the cuticle, it follows that the
anterior wall of each belongs to the somite in front, and
the posterior wall to the somite behind. All four apodemes
lie in the ventral half of the somite and form a single
transverse series; consequently there are two nearer
the middle line, which are termed the <i>endosternites</i>, and
two further off, which are the <i>endopleurites</i>. The former
lie at the inner, and the latter at the outer ends of the
partitions or <i>arthrophragms</i> (fig.
<a href="#f39" title="go to &#x66;ig. 39">39</a>, A, <i>a, a′</i>, fig.
<a href="#f42" title="go to &#x66;ig. 42">42</a>, <i>aph</i>),
between the articular cavities for the basal joints of the
limbs, and they spring partly from the latter and partly
from the sternum and the epimera respectively.</p>

<p>The endosternite (fig.
<a href="#f42" title="go to &#x66;ig. 42">42</a>, <i>ens.</i>) ascends vertically, with a
slight inclination forwards, and its summit narrows and
assumes the form of a pillar, with a flat, transversely
elongated capital. The inner prolongation of the capital
is called the <i>mesophragm</i> (<i>mph.</i>), the outer <i>paraphragm</i>
(<i>pph.</i>). The mesophragms of the two endosternites of a
somite usually unite by a median suture, and thus form
a complete arch over the sternal canal (<i>s.c.</i>), which lies
between the endosternites. <span class="xxpn" id="p159">{159}</span></p>

<p>The endopleurites (<i>en.pl.</i>) are also vertical plates, but
they are relatively shorter, and their inner angles give off
two nearly horizontal processes, one of which passes
obliquely forwards (fig.
<a href="#f39" title="go to &#x66;ig. 39">39</a>, B, <i>h</i>, fig.
<a href="#f42" title="go to &#x66;ig. 42">42</a>, <i>h.p.</i>) and unites
with the paraphragm of the endosternite of the somite
in front, while the other, passing obliquely backwards
(fig.
<a href="#f39" title="go to &#x66;ig. 39">39</a>, <i>h′</i>), becomes similarly connected with the endosternite
of the somite behind.</p>

<p>The endopleurites of the last thoracic somite are rudimentary,
and its endosternites are small. On the other
hand, the mesophragmal processes of the endosternites of
the two posterior somites of the head (fig.
<a href="#f39" title="go to &#x66;ig. 39">39</a>, B, <i>c.ap</i>), by
which the endophragmal system terminates in front, are
particularly strong and closely united together. They
thus, with their endopleurites, form a solid partition between
the stomach, which lies upon them, and
the mass of <span class="xxpn" id="p160">{160}</span>
coalesced anterior thoracic and posterior cephalic ganglia
situated beneath them. Strong processes are given off
from their anterior and outer angles, which curve round
the tendons of the adductor muscles of the mandibles, and
give attachment to the abductors.</p>

<p>In front of the mouth there is no such endophragmal
system as that which lies behind it. But the anterior gastric
muscles are attached to two flat calcified plates, which
appear to lie in the interior of the head (though they are
really situated in its upper and front wall) on each side
of the base of the rostrum, and are called the <i>procephalic
processes</i> (figs.
<a href="#f40" title="go to &#x66;ig. 40">40</a>,
<a href="#f43" title="go to &#x66;ig. 43">43</a>, <i>p.cp</i>). Each of these plates constitutes
the posterior wall of a narrow cavity which opens
externally into the roof of the orbit, and has been regarded
(though, as it appears to me, without sufficient reason) as
an olfactory organ. I am disposed to think, though I
have not been able to obtain complete evidence of the
fact, that the procephalic processes are the representatives
of the “procephalic lobes” which terminate the
anterior end of the body in the embryo crayfish. At
any rate, they occupy the same position relatively to the
eyes and to the carapace; and the hidden position of
these processes, in the adult, appears to arise from the
extension of the carapace at the base of the rostrum
over the fore part of the originally free sternal surface of
the head. It has thus covered over the procephalic
processes, in which the sternal wall of the body terminated;
and the cavities which lie in front
of them are <span class="xxpn" id="p161">{161}</span>
simply the interspaces left between the inferior or
posterior wall of the prolongation of the carapace and
the originally exposed external faces of these regions of
the cephalic integument.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Fourteen somites having thus been distinguished in
the cephalothorax, and six being obvious in the abdomen,
it is clear that there is a somite for every pair of appendages.
And, if we suppose the carapace divided into
segments answering to these sterna, the whole body will
be made up of twenty somites, each having a pair of
appendages. As the carapace, however, is not actually
divided into terga in correspondence with the sterna
which it covers, all we can safely conclude from the
anatomical facts is that it represents the tergal region of
the somites, not that it is formed by the coalescence of
primarily distinct terga. In the head, and in the greater
part of the thorax, the somites are, as it were, run
together, but the last thoracic somite is partly free and
to a slight extent moveable, while the abdominal somites
are all free, and moveably articulated together. At the
anterior end of the body, and, apparently, from the antennary
somite, the tergal region gives rise to the
rostrum, which projects between and beyond the eyes.
At the opposite extremity, the telson is a corresponding
median outgrowth of the last somite, which has become
moveably articulated therewith. The narrowing of the
sternal moieties of the
anterior thoracic somites, <span class="xxpn" id="p162">{162}</span>
together with the sudden widening of the same parts in
the posterior cephalic somites, gives rise to the lateral
depression (fig.
<a href="#f39" title="go to &#x66;ig. 39">39</a>, <i>cf</i>) in which the scaphognathite lies.
The limit thus indicated corresponds with that marked
by the cervical groove upon the surface of the carapace,
and separates the head from the thorax. The three pair
of maxillipedes (<i>7, 8, 9</i>), the forceps (<i>10</i>), the ambulatory
<span class="xxpn" id="p163">{163}</span>
limbs (<i>11–14</i>), and the eight somites of which they are
the appendages (<i>VII–XIV</i>), lie behind this boundary
and belong to the thorax. The two pairs of maxillæ (<i>5, 6</i>)
the mandibles (<i>4</i>), the antennæ (<i>3</i>), the antennules (<i>2</i>),
the eyestalks (<i>1</i>), and the six somites to which they are
attached (<i>I–VI</i>), lie in front of the boundary and compose
the head.</p>

<p>Another important point to be noticed is that, in front
of the mouth, the sternum of the antennary somite (fig.
<a href="#f43" title="go to &#x66;ig. 43">43</a>, <i>III</i>) is inclined at an angle of 60° or 70° to the direction
of the sterna behind the mouth. The sternum of the
antennulary somite (<i>II</i>) is at right angles to the latter; and
that of the eyes (<i>I</i>) looks upwards as well as forwards.
Hence, the front of the head beneath the rostrum, though
it looks forwards, or even upwards, is homologous with the
sternal aspect of the other somites. It is for this reason
that the feelers and the eyestalks take a direction so different
from that of the other appendages. The change
of aspect of the sternal surface in front of the mouth,
thus effected, is what is termed the <i>cephalic flexure</i>.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Since the skeleton which invests the trunk of the crayfish
is made up of a twenty-fold repetition of somites,
homologous with those of the abdomen, we may expect
to find that the appendages of the thorax and of the head,
however unlike they may seem to be to those of the abdomen,
are nevertheless reducible to the same fundamental
plan. <span class="xxpn" id="p164">{164}</span></p>

<p>The third maxillipede is one of the most complete of
these appendages, and may be advantageously made the
starting point of the study of the whole series.</p>

<p>Neglecting details for the moment, it may
be said that the appendage consists of a basal
portion (fig.
<a href="#f44" title="go to &#x66;ig. 44">44</a>, <i>cxp, bp</i>), <span class="xxpn"
id="p165">{165}</span> with two terminal divisions
(<i>ip</i> to <i>dp</i>, and <i>ex</i>), which are directed forwards,
below the mouth, and a third, lateral appendage
(<i>e, br</i>), which runs up, beneath the carapace,
into the branchial chamber. The latter is the gill,
or podobranchia, attached to this limb, and it is
something not represented in the abdominal limbs. But,
with regard to the rest of the maxillipede, it is
obvious that the basal portion (<i>cxp, bp</i>) represents
the protopodite, and the two terminal divisions the
endopodite and the exopodite respectively. It has
been observed that, in the abdominal appendages, the
extent to which segmentation occurs in homologous
parts varies indefinitely; an endopodite, for example,
may be a continuous plate, or may be subdivided into
many joints. In the maxillipede, the basal portion
is divided into two joints; and, as in the abdominal
limb, the first, or that which articulates with the
thorax, is termed the <i>coxopodite</i> (<i>cxp</i>), while the
second is the <i>basipodite</i> (<i>bp</i>). The stout, leg-like
endopodite appears to be the direct continuation
of the basipodite; while the much more narrow and
slender exopodite articulates with its outer side.
The exopodite (<i>ex</i>) is by no means unlike one of the
exopodites of the abdominal limbs, consisting as it
does of an undivided base and a many-jointed terminal
filament. The endopodite, on the contrary, is strong
and massive, and is divided into five joints, named,
from that nearest to the base onwards, <i>ischiopodite</i>
(<i>ip</i>), <i>meropodite</i> (<i>mp</i>), <i>carpopodite</i> (<i>cp</i>),
<i>propodite</i> (<i>pp</i>), and <i>dactylopodite</i> (<i>dp</i>). <span

<p>The second maxillipede (fig.
<a href="#f45" title="go to &#x66;ig. 45">45</a>, B) has essentially the
same composition as the first, but the exopodite (<i>ex</i>) is
relatively larger, the endopodite (<i>ip–dp</i>) smaller and
softer; and, while the ischiopodite (<i>ip</i>) is the longest
joint in the third maxillipede, it is the meropodite (<i>mp</i>)
which is longest in the second. In the first maxillipede
(fig.
<a href="#f45" title="go to &#x66;ig. 45">45</a>, A) a great modification has taken place. The
coxopodite (<i>cxp</i>) and the basipodite (<i>bp</i>) are broad thin
plates with setose cutting edges, while the endopodite
(<i>en</i>) is short and only two-jointed, and the undivided
portion of the exopodite (<i>ex</i>) is very long.
The place of <span class="xxpn" id="p167">{167}</span>
the podobranchia is taken by a broad soft membranous
plate entirely devoid of branchial filaments (<i>ep</i>). Thus,
in the series of the thoracic limbs, on passing forwards
from the third maxillipede, we find that though the plan
of the appendages remains the same; (1) the protopodite
increases in relative size; (2) the endopodite diminishes;
(3) the exopodite increases; (4) the podobranchia finally
takes the form of a broad membranous plate and loses its
branchial filaments.</p>

<p>Writers on descriptive Zoology usually refer to the
parts of the maxillipedes under different names from those
which are employed here. The protopodite and the endopodite
taken together are commonly called the <i>stem</i> of
the maxillipede, while the exopodite is the <i>palp</i>, and the
metamorphosed podobranchia, the real nature of which
is not recognised, is termed the <i>flagellum</i>.</p>

<p>When the comparison of the maxillipedes with the
abdominal members, however, had shown the fundamental
uniformity of composition of the two, it became
desirable to invent a nomenclature of the homologous
parts which should be capable of a general application.
The names of protopodite, endopodite, exopodite, which
I have adopted as the equivalents of the “stem” and the
“palp,” were proposed by Milne-Edwards, who at the
same time suggested <i>epipodite</i> for the “flagellum.” And
the lamellar process of the first maxillipede is now very
generally termed an epipodite; while the podobranchiæ,
which have exactly the same relations
to the following <span class="xxpn" id="p168">{168}</span>
limbs, are spoken of as if they were totally different
structures, under the name of branchiæ or gills.</p>

<p>The flagellum or epipodite of the first maxillipede,
however, is nothing but the slightly modified stem of a
podobranchia, which has lost its branchial filaments;
but the term “epipodite” may be conveniently used for
podobranchiæ thus modified. Unfortunately, the same
term is applied to certain lamelliform portions of the
branchiæ of other crustacea, which answer to the laminæ
of the crayfishes’ branchiæ; and this ambiguity must be
borne in mind, though it is of no great moment.</p>

<p>On examining an appendage from that part of the
thorax which lies behind the third maxillipede, say, for
example, the sixth thoracic limb (the second walking leg)
(fig.
<a href="#f46" title="go to &#x66;ig. 46">46</a>), the two joints of the protopodite and the five
joints of the endopodite are at once identifiable, and so
is the podobranchia; but the exopodite has vanished
altogether. In the eighth, or last, thoracic limb, the
podobranchia has also disappeared. The fifth and
sixth limbs also differ from the seventh and eighth,
in being chelate; that is to say, one angle of the distal
end of the propodite is prolonged and forms the fixed leg
of the pincer. The produced angle is that which is
turned downwards when the limb is fully extended
(fig.
<a href="#f46" title="go to &#x66;ig. 46">46</a>). In the forceps, the great chela is formed in
just the same way; the only important difference lies in
the fact that, as in the external maxillipede, the basipodite
and the ischiopodite are
immoveably united. Thus, <span class="xxpn" id="p170">{170}</span>
the limbs of the thorax are all reducible to the same type
as those of the abdomen, if we suppose that, in the
posterior five pair, the exopodites are suppressed; and
that, in all but the last, podobranchiæ are superadded.</p>

<p>Turning to the appendages of the head, the second
maxilla (fig.
<a href="#f47" title="go to &#x66;ig. 47">47</a>, C) presents a further modification of the
disposition of the parts seen in the first maxillipede.
The coxopodite (<i>cxp</i>) and the basipodite (<i>bp</i>) are still
thinner and more lamellar, and are subdivided by deep
fissures which extend from their inner edges. The
endopodite (<i>en</i>) is very small and undivided. In the
place of the exopodite and the epipodite there is only
one great plate, the scaphognathite (<i>sg</i>) which either
is such an epipodite as that of the first maxillipede
with its anterior basal process much enlarged, or represents
both the exopodite and the epipodite. In the first
maxilla (B), the exopodite and the epipodite have disappeared,
and the endopodite (<i>en</i>) is insignificant and
unjointed. In the mandibles (A), the representative of
the protopodite is strong and transversely elongated. Its
broad inner or oral end presents a semicircular masticatory
surface divided by a deep longitudinal groove into
two toothed ridges. The one of these follows the convex
anterior or inferior contour of the masticatory surface,
projects far beyond the other, and is provided with a sharp
serrated edge; the other (fig.
<a href="#f43" title="go to &#x66;ig. 43">43</a>, <i>a</i>) gives rise to the straight
posterior or superior contour of the masticatory surface,
and is more obtusely tuberculated. In
front, the inner <span class="xxpn" id="p171">{171}</span>
ridge is continued into a process by which the mandible
articulates with the epistoma (fig.
<a href="#f47" title="go to &#x66;ig. 47">47</a>, A, <i>ar</i>). The endopodite
is represented by the three-jointed <i>palp</i> (<i>p</i>), the
terminal joint of which is oval and beset with numerous
strong setæ, which are especially abundant along its
anterior edge.</p>

<p>In the antenna (fig.
<a href="#f48" title="go to &#x66;ig. 48">48</a>, C) the protopodite is two-jointed.
The basal segment is small, and its ventral
face presents the conical prominence on the posterior
aspect of which is the aperture of the duct of the renal
gland (<i>gg</i>). The terminal segment is larger and is subdivided
by deep longitudinal folds, one upon the dorsal and
one upon the ventral face, into two moieties which are
more or less moveable upon one another. In front and
externally it bears the broad flat <i>squame</i> (<i>exp</i>) of the antenna,
as an exopodite. Internally, the long annulated
“feeler” which represents the endopodite, is connected
with it by two stout basal segments.</p>

<div class="dxxpn"><span

<p>The antennule (fig.
<a href="#f48" title="go to &#x66;ig. 48">48</a>, B) has a three-jointed
stem and two terminal annulated filaments, the outer
of which is thicker and longer than the inner, and
lies rather above as well as external to the latter.
The peculiar form of the basal segment of the stem
of the antennule has already been adverted to (p. <a
href="#p116" title="go to &#x70;. 116">116</a>). It
is longer than the other two segments put together,
and near the anterior end its sternal edge is
produced into a single strong spine (<i>a</i>). The stem
of the antennule answers to the protopodite of the
other limbs, though its division into three joints
is unusual; the two terminal annulated filaments
represent the endopodite and the exopodite.</p>

<p>Finally, the eyestalk (A) has just the same structure
as the protopodite of an abdominal limb, having a short
basal and a long cylindrical terminal joint.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>From this brief statement of the characters of the appendages,
it is clear that, in whatever sense it is allowable to
say that the appendages of the abdomen are constructed
upon one plan, which is modified in execution by the
excess of development of one part over another, or by the
suppression of parts, or by the coalescence of one part
with another, it is allowable to say that all the appendages
are constructed on the same plan, and are modified
on similar principles. Given a general type of appendage
consisting of a protopodite, bearing a podobranchia, an
endopodite and an exopodite, all the actual appendages
are readily derivable
from that type. <span class="xxpn" id="p174">{174}</span></p>

<p>In addition, therefore, to their adaptation to the purposes
which they subserve, the parts of the skeleton
of the crayfish show a unity in diversity, such as, if
the animal were a piece of human workmanship, would
lead us to suppose that the artificer was under an obligation
not merely to make a machine capable of doing certain
kinds of work, but to subordinate the nature and
arrangement of the mechanism to certain fixed architectural
conditions.</p>

<p>The lesson thus taught by the skeletal organs is reiterated
and enforced by the study of the nervous and the
muscular systems. As the skeleton of the whole body is
capable of resolution into the skeletons of twenty separate
metameres, variously modified and combined; so is the
entire ganglionic chain resolvable into twenty pairs of
ganglia various in size, distant in this region and
approximated in that; and so is the muscular system
of the trunk conceivable as the sum of twenty
<i>myotomes</i> or segments of the muscular system appropriate
to a metamere, variously modified according to
the degree of mobility of the different regions of the
organism.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The building up of the body by the repetition and
the modification of a few similar parts, which is so obvious
from the study of the general form of the somites
and of their appendages, is still more remarkably illustrated,
if we pursue our investigations
further, and trace <span class="xxpn" id="p175">{175}</span>
out the more intimate structure of these parts. The
tough, outer coat, which has been termed the <i>cuticula</i>,
except so far as it presents different degrees of hardness,
from the presence or absence of calcareous salts, is
obviously everywhere of the same nature; and, by
macerating a crayfish in caustic alkali, which destroys all
its other components of the body, it will be readily
enough seen that a continuation of the cuticular layer
passes in at the mouth and the vent, and lines the
alimentary canal; furthermore, that processes of the
cuticle covering various parts of the trunk and limbs
extend inwards, and afford surfaces of attachment to the
muscles, as the <i>apodemata</i> and <i>tendons</i>. In technical
language, the cuticular substance which thus enters so
largely into the composition of the bodily fabric of the
crayfish is called a <i>tissue</i>.</p>

<p>The flesh, or <i>muscle</i>, is another kind of tissue, which
is readily enough distinguished from cuticular tissue by
the naked eye; but, for a complete discrimination of
all the different tissues, recourse must be had to the
microscope, the application of which to the study of
the ultimate optical characters of the morphological
constituents of the body has given rise to that branch
of morphology which is known as <i>Histology</i>.</p>

<p>If we count every formed element of the body, which
is separable from the rest by definite characters, as a
tissue, there are no more than eight kinds of such tissues
in the crayfish; that is to say,
every solid constituent <span class="xxpn" id="p176">{176}</span>
of the body consists of one or more of the following eight
histological groups:—</p>

<p><span class="spbold">1.</span> Blood corpuscles; 2.
Epithelium; 3. Connective tissue; 4. Muscle; 5. Nerve;
6. Ova; 7. Spermatozoa; 8. Cuticle.</p>

<p>1. A drop of freshly-drawn blood of the crayfish
contains multitudes of small particles, the <i>blood
corpuscles</i>, which rarely exceed 1‐700th, and usually
are about 1‐1000th, of an inch in diameter (fig. <a
href="#f49" title="go to &#x66;ig. 49">49</a>). They
are sometimes pale and delicate, but generally more
or less dark, from containing a number of minute
strongly refracting granules, and they are ordinarily
exceedingly irregular in form. If one of them is
watched <span class="xxpn" id="p177">{177}</span>
continuously for two or three minutes, its shape will
be seen to undergo the constant but slow changes to
which passing reference has already been made (p. <a
href="#p069" title="go to &#x70;. 69">69</a>). One or
other of the irregular prolongations will be drawn in,
and another thrown out elsewhere. The corpuscle, in
fact, has an inherent contractility, like one of those
low organisms, known as an <i>Amœba</i>, whence its motions
are frequently called <i>amœbiform</i>. In its interior,
an ill-marked oval contour may be seen, indicating
the presence of a spheroidal body, about 1‐2000th
of an inch in diameter, which is the nucleus of the
corpuscle (<i>n</i>). The addition of some re-agents,
such as dilute acetic acid, causes the corpuscles
at once to assume a spherical shape, and renders
the nucleus very conspicuous (fig. <a href="#f49"
title="go to &#x66;ig. 49">49</a>, <i>9</i> and <i>10</i>). The
blood corpuscle is, in fact, a simple nucleated cell,
composed of a contractile protoplasmic mass, investing
a nucleus; it is suspended freely in the blood;
and, though as much a part of the crayfish organism
as any other of its histological elements, leads a
quasi-independent existence in that fluid.</p>

<p>2. Under the general name of <i>epithelium</i>, may be included
a form of tissue, which everywhere underlies the
exoskeleton (where it corresponds with the epidermis of the
higher animals), and the cuticular lining of the alimentary
canal, extending thence into the hepatic cæca. It is
further met with in the generative organs, and in the green
gland. Where it forms the subcuticular layer of the
integument and of the alimentary canal, it
is found to <span class="xxpn" id="p178">{178}</span>
consist of a protoplasmic substance (fig.
<a href="#f50" title="go to &#x66;ig. 50">50</a>), in which close
set nuclei (<i>n</i>) are imbedded. If a number of blood corpuscles
could be supposed to be closely aggregated together
into a continuous sheet, they would give rise to such a
structure as this; and there can be no doubt that it
really is an aggregate of nucleated cells, though the
limits between the individual cells are rarely visible in the
fresh state. In the liver, however, the cells grow, and
become detached from one another in the wider and lower
parts of the cæca, and their essential nature is thus
obvious.</p>

<p>The connective tissue presents itself under three forms.
In the first there is a transparent homogeneous-looking
matrix, or ground substance, through which are scattered
many nuclei. In fact, this form
of connective tissue <span class="xxpn" id="p179">{179}</span>
very closely resembles the epithelial tissue, except that
the intervals between the nuclei are wider, and that the
substance in which they are imbedded cannot be broken
up into a separate cell-body for each nucleus. In the
second form (fig.
<a href="#f51" title="go to &#x66;ig. 51">51</a>, <i>A</i>) the matrix exhibits fine wavy
parallel lines, as if it were marked out into imperfect
fibres. In this form, as in the next to be described,
more or less spherical cavities, which contain a clear
fluid, are excavated in the matrix; and
the number of <span class="xxpn" id="p180">{180}</span>
these is sometimes so great, that the matrix is proportionally
very much reduced, and the structure acquires a
close superficial similarity to that of the parenchyma of
plants. This is still more the case with a third form, in
which the matrix itself is marked off into elongated or
rounded masses, each of which has a nucleus in its
interior (fig.
<a href="#f51" title="go to &#x66;ig. 51">51</a>, <i>B</i>). Under one form or another, the
connective tissue extends throughout the body, ensheathing
the various organs, and forming the walls of the blood
sinuses.</p>

<p>The third form is particularly abundant in the outer
investment of the heart, the arteries, the alimentary
canal, and the nervous centres. About the cerebral and
anterior thoracic ganglia, and on the exterior of the
heart, it usually contains more or less fatty matter. In
these regions, many of the nuclei, in fact, are hidden by
the accumulation round them of granules of various
sizes, some of which are composed of fat, while others
consist of a proteinaceous material. These aggregates
of granules are usually spheroidal; and, with the matrix in
which they are imbedded and the nucleus which they surround,
they are often readily detached when a portion of
the connective tissue is teased out, and are then known as
<i>fat cells</i>. From what has been said respecting the distribution
of the connective tissue, it is obvious that if
all the other tissues could be removed, this tissue would
form a continuous whole, and represent a sort of model,
or cast, of the whole body
of the crayfish. <span class="xxpn" id="p181">{181}</span></p>

another varies with the condition of the muscle, from
1‐4,000th of an inch in the quiescent state to as little as
1‐30,000th of an inch in that of extreme contraction.
The more delicate muscular fibres, like those of the
heart and those of the intestine, are imbedded in the
connective tissue of the organ, but have no special sheaths.
The fibres which make up the more conspicuous muscles
of the trunk and limbs, on the other hand, are much
larger, and are invested by a thin, transparent, structureless
sheath, which is termed the <i>sarcolemma</i>. Nuclei
are scattered, at intervals, through the striated substance
of the muscle; and, in the larger muscular fibres, a layer
of nucleated protoplasm lies between the sarcolemma and
the striated muscle substance.</p>

<p>This much is readily seen in a specimen of muscular
fibre taken from any part of the body, and whether alive
or dead. But the results of the ultimate optical analysis
of these appearances, and the conclusions respecting the
normal structure of striped muscle which may be legitimately
drawn from them, have been the subjects of much
controversy.</p>

<p>Quiescent muscular fibres from the chela of the forceps
of a crayfish, examined while still living, without the
addition of any extraneous fluid, and with magnifying
powers of not less than seven or eight hundred diameters,
exhibit the following appearance. At intervals of about
1‐4000th of an inch, very delicate but dark and well-defined
transverse lines are visible; and these, on careful
focussing, appear beaded, as if they were made of a series
of close-set minute granules not more than 1‐20,000th
to 1‐30,000th of an inch in diameter. These may be
termed the <i>septal lines</i> (fig.
<a href="#f52" title="go to &#x66;ig. 52">52</a>, D and E, <i>a</i>; C, <i>1–5</i>;
fig.
<a href="#f53" title="go to &#x66;ig. 53">53</a>, <i>s</i>). On each side of every septal line there
is a very narrow perfectly transparent band, which may
be distinguished as the <i>septal zone</i> (fig.
<a href="#f53" title="go to &#x66;ig. 53">53</a>, <i>sz</i>). Upon
this follows a relatively broad band of a substance which
has a semi-transparent aspect, like very finely ground
glass, and hence appears somewhat dark relatively to the
septal zone. Upon this <i>inter-septal zone</i> (<i>i&#x202f;s</i>) follows
another septal zone, then a septal line, another septal
zone, an inter-septal zone, and so on throughout the
whole length
of the fibre. <span class="xxpn" id="p184">{184}</span></p>

<p>In the perfectly unaltered state of the muscle no other
transverse markings than these are discernible. But it is
always possible to observe certain longitudinal markings;
and these are of three kinds. In the first place, the nuclei
which, in the perfectly fresh muscle, are delicate transparent
oval bodies, are lodged in spaces which taper off at
each end into narrow longitudinal clefts (fig.
<a href="#f52" title="go to &#x66;ig. 52">52</a>, A, B). Prolongations
of the protoplasmic sheath of the fibre extend
inwards and fill these clefts. Secondly, there are similar
clefts interposed between these, but narrow and merely
linear throughout. Sometimes these clefts contain fine
granules. Thirdly, even in the perfectly fresh muscle,
extremely faint parallel longitudinal striæ 1‐7,000th
of an inch, or thereabouts, apart, traverse the several
zones, so that longer or shorter segments of the
successive septal lines are inclosed between them. A
transverse section of the muscle appears divided into
rounded or polygonal areæ of the same diameter, separated
from one another here and there by minute interstices.
Moreover, on examination of perfectly fresh
muscle with high magnifying powers, the septal lines are
hardly ever straight for any distance, but are broken up
into short lengths, which answer to one or more of the
longitudinal divisions, and stand at slightly different
heights.</p>

<p>The only conclusion to be drawn from these appearances
seems to me to be that the substance of the muscle
is composed of distinct <i>fibrils</i>; and
that the longitudinal <span class="xxpn" id="p185">{185}</span>
striæ and the rounded areæ of the transverse section are
simply the optical expressions of the boundaries of these
fibrils. In the perfectly unaltered state of the tissue,
however, the fibrils are so closely packed that their
boundaries are scarcely discernible.</p>

<p>Thus each muscular <i>fibre</i> may be regarded as composed
of larger and smaller bundles of <i>fibrils</i> imbedded
in a nucleated protoplasmic framework which
ensheaths the whole and is itself invested by the sarcolemma.</p>

<p>As the fibre dies, the nuclei acquire hard, dark contours
and their contents become granular, while at the same
time the fibrils acquire sharp and well-defined boundaries.
In fact, the fibre may now be readily teased out with
needles, and the fibrils isolated.</p>

<p>In muscle which has been treated with various reagents,
such as alcohol, nitric acid, or solution of common salt,
the fibrils themselves may be split up into filaments of
extreme tenuity, each of which appears to answer to
one of the granules of the septal lines. Such an
isolated <i>muscle filament</i> looks like a very fine thread
carrying minute beads at regular intervals.</p>

<p>The septal lines resist most reagents, and remain
visible in muscular fibres which have been subjected to
various modes of treatment; but they may have the
appearance of continuous bars, or be more or less completely
resolved into separate granules, according to circumstances.
On the other hand, what is to
be seen in <span class="xxpn" id="p186">{186}</span>
the interspace between every two septal lines depends
upon the reagent employed. With dilute acids and
strong solutions of salt, the inter-septal substance swells
up and becomes transparent, so that it ceases to be distinguishable
from the septal zone. At the same time a
distinct but faint transverse line may appear in the
middle of its length. Strong nitric acid, on the contrary,
renders the inter-septal substance more opaque,
and the septal zones consequently appear very well
defined.</p>

<p>In living and recently dead muscle, as well as in
muscles which have been preserved in spirit or hardened
with nitric acid, the inter-septal zones polarize light; and
hence, in the dark field of the polarizing microscope, the
fibre appears crossed by bright bands, which correspond
with the inter-septal zones, or at any rate, with the
middle parts of them. The substance which forms the
septal zones, on the contrary, produces no such effect,
and consequently remains dark; while the septal lines
again have the same property as the inter-septal substance,
though in a less degree.</p>

<p>In fibres which have been acted upon by solution of
salt, or dilute acids, the inter-septal zones have lost
their polarizing property. As we know that the reagents
in question dissolve the peculiar constituent of muscle,
<i>myosin</i>, it is to be concluded that the inter-septal substance
is chiefly composed of myosin.</p>

<p>Thus a fibril may be considered to be
made up of <span class="xxpn" id="p187">{187}</span>
segments of different material arranged in regular order;
S–sz–IS–sz–S–sz–IS–sz–S: S representing the
septal line; sz, the septal zone; IS, the inter-septal zone.
Of these, IS is the chief if not the only seat of the
myosin; what the composition of sz and of S may be
is uncertain, but the supposition, that, in the living
muscle, sz is a mere fluid, appears to me to be wholly
inadmissible.</p>

<p>When living muscle contracts, the inter-septal zones
become shorter and wider and their margins darker,
while the septal zones and the septal lines tend to
become effaced—as it appears to me simply in consequence
of the approximation of the lateral margins of
the inter-septal zones. It is probable that the substance
of the intermediate zone is the chief, if not the
only, seat of the activity of the muscle during contraction.</p>

<p>5. The elements of the <i>nervous tissue</i> are of two kinds,
<i>nerve-cells</i>, and <i>nerve fibres</i>; the former are found in the
ganglia, and they vary very much in size (fig.
<a href="#f54" title="go to &#x66;ig. 54">54</a>, B). Each
ganglionic corpuscle consists of a cell body produced
into one or more processes which sometimes, if not
always, end in nerve fibres. A large, clear spherical
nucleus is seen in the interior of the nerve-cell; and
in the centre of this is a well defined, small round
particle, the <i>nucleolus</i>. The corpuscle, when isolated,
is often surrounded by a sort of sheath of small nucleated
cells. <span class="xxpn" id="p188">{188}</span></p>

<p>The nerve fibres (fig.
<a href="#f55" title="go to &#x66;ig. 55">55</a>) of the crayfish are remarkable
for the large size which some of them attain. In the
central nervous system a few reach as much as 1‐200th of
an inch in diameter; and fibres of 1‐300th or 1‐400th of
an inch in diameter are not rare in the main branches.
Each fibre is a tube, formed of a strong and elastic, sometimes
fibrillated, sheath, in which nuclei are imbedded
at irregular intervals; and, when the
nerve trunk gives <span class="xxpn" id="p189">{189}</span>
off a branch, more or fewer of these tubes divide, sending
off a prolongation into each branch.</p>

fluviatilis.</i>—Three nerve fibres, with the connective
tissue in which they are imbedded (magnified about 250
diameters); <i>n</i>, nuclei.</div></div>

<p>When quite fresh, the contents of the tubes are perfectly
pellucid, and without the least indication of structure;
and, from the manner in which the contents
exude from the cut ends of the tubes, it is evident that
they consist of a fluid of gelatinous consistency. As the
fibre dies, and under the influence of water and of many
chemical re-agents, the contents break up into globules
or become turbid and finely granular.</p>

<p>Where motor nerve fibres terminate in the muscles
to which they are distributed, the sheath of each
fibre becomes continuous with the sarcolemma of the
muscle, and the subjacent protoplasm is commonly
raised into a small prominence which contains
several nuclei (fig.
<a href="#f52" title="go to &#x66;ig. 52">52</a>, F). These are called the
<i>terminal</i> or <i>motor plates</i>. <span class="xxpn"

<p>6, 7. The <i>ova</i> and the <i>spermatozoa</i> have already been
described (pp. <a href="#p132" title="go to &#x70;. 132">132</a>–135).</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>It will be observed that the blood corpuscles, the
epithelial tissues, the ganglionic corpuscles, the ova
and the spermatozoa, are all demonstrably nucleated
cells, more or less modified. The first form of connective
tissue is so similar to epithelial tissue, that it may
obviously be regarded as an aggregate of as many cells as
it presents nuclei, the matrix representing the more or
less modified and confluent bodies of the cells, or products
of these. But if this be so, then the second and third
forms have a similar composition, except so far as the
matrix of the cells has become fibrillated, or vacuolated,
or marked off into masses corresponding with the several
nuclei. By a parity of reasoning, muscular tissue may
also be considered a cell aggregate, in which the inter-nuclear
substance has become converted into striated
muscle; while, in the nerve fibres, a like process of
metamorphosis may have given rise to the pellucid
gelatinous nerve substance. But, if we accept the
conclusions thus suggested by the comparison of the
various tissues with one another, it follows that every
histological element, which has now been mentioned,
is either a simple nucleated cell, a modified nucleated
cell, or a more or less modified cell aggregate. In
other words, every tissue is resolvable into nucleated
cells. <span class="xxpn" id="p191">{191}</span></p>

<p>A notable exception to this generalisation, however,
obtains in the case of the <i>cuticular structures</i>, in which
no cellular components are discoverable. In its simplest
form, such as that presented by the lining of the intestine,
the cuticle is a delicate, transparent membrane,
thrown off from the surface of the subjacent cells, either
by a process of exudation, or by the chemical transformation
of their superficial layer. No pores are discernible
in this membrane, but scattered over its surface
there are oval patches of extremely minute, sharp conical
processes, which are rarely more than 1‐5,000th of an
inch long. Where the cuticle is thicker, as in the
stomach and in the exoskeleton, it presents a stratified
appearance, as if it were composed of a number of laminæ,
of varying thickness, which had been successively thrown
off from the subjacent cells.</p>

<p>Where the cuticular layer of the integument is uncalcified,
for example, between the sterna of the abdominal
somites, it presents an external, thin, dense,
wrinkled lamina, the <i>epiostracum</i>, followed by a soft
substance, which, on vertical section, presents numerous
alternately more transparent and more opaque bands,
which run parallel with one another and with the free
surfaces of the slice (fig.
<a href="#f56" title="go to &#x66;ig. 56">56</a>, D). These bands are very
close-set, often not more than 1‐5000th of an inch apart
near the outer and the inner surfaces, but in the middle
of the section they are more distant.</p>

<p>If a thin vertical slice of the soft
cuticle is gently <span class="xxpn" id="p193">{193}</span>
pulled with needles in the direction of its depth, it
stretches to eight or ten times its previous diameter,
the clear intervals between the dark bands becoming
proportionally enlarged, especially in the middle of the
slice, while the dark bands themselves become apparently
thinner, and more sharply defined. The dark bands
may then be readily drawn to a distance of as much as
1‐300th of an inch from one another; but if the slice is
stretched further, it splits along, or close to, one of the
dark lines. The whole of the cuticular layer is stained
by such colouring matters as hæmatoxylin; and, as the
dark bands become more deeply coloured than the intermediate
transparent substance, the transverse stratification
is made very manifest by this treatment.</p>

<p>Examined with a high magnifying power, the transparent
substance is seen to be traversed by close-set,
faint, vertical lines, while the dark bands are shown to
be produced by the cut edges of delicate laminæ, having
a finely striated appearance, as if they were composed
of delicate parallel wavy fibrillæ.</p>

<p>In the calcified parts of the exoskeleton a thin, tough,
wrinkled epiostracum (fig.
<a href="#f56" title="go to &#x66;ig. 56">56</a>, B, <i>a</i>), and, subjacent to
this, a number of alternately lighter and darker strata
are similarly discernible: though all but the innermost
laminæ are hardened by a deposit of calcareous salts,
which are generally evenly diffused, but sometimes take
the shape of rounded masses with irregular contours.</p>

<p>Immediately beneath the epiostracum, there
is a zone <span class="xxpn" id="p194">{194}</span>
which may occupy a sixth or a seventh of the thickness
of the whole, which is more transparent than the rest,
and often presents hardly any trace of horizontal or
vertical striation. When it appears laminated, the strata
are very thin. This zone may be distinguished as the
<i>ectostracum</i> (<i>b</i>), from the <i>endostracum</i> (<i>c</i>), which makes
up the rest of the exoskeleton. In the outer part of the
endostracum, the strata are distinct, and may be as much
as 1‐500th of an inch thick, but in the inner part they
become very thin, and the lines which separate them
may be not more than 1‐8000th of an inch apart.
Fine, parallel, close-set, vertical striæ (<i>e</i>) traverse all the
strata of the endostracum, and may usually be traced
through the ectostracum, though they are always faint,
and sometimes hardly discernible, in this region. When
a high magnifying power is employed, it is seen that
these striæ, which are about 1‐7000th of an inch apart,
are not straight, but that they present regular short undulations,
the alternate convexities and concavities of
which correspond with the light and the dark bands
respectively.</p>

<p>If the hard exoskeleton has been allowed to become
partially or wholly dry before the section is made, the
latter will look white by reflected and black by transmitted
light, in consequence of the places of the striæ
being taken by threads of air of such extreme tenuity,
that they may measure not more than 1‐30,000th of an
inch in diameter. It is to be
concluded, therefore, that <span class="xxpn" id="p195">{195}</span>
the striæ are the optical indications of parallel undulating
canals which traverse the successive strata of the cuticle,
and are ordinarily occupied by a fluid. When this dries
up, the surrounding air enters, and more or less completely
fills the tubes. And that this is really the case
may be proved by making very thin sections parallel with
the face of the exoskeleton, for these exhibit innumerable
minute perforations, set at regular distances from one
another, which correspond with the intervals between the
striæ in the vertical section; and sometimes the contours
of the areæ which separate the apertures are so well
defined as to suggest a pavement of minute angular
blocks, the corners of which do not quite meet.</p>

<p>When a portion of the hard exoskeleton is decalcified,
a chitinous substance remains, which presents the same
structure as that just described, except that the epiostracum
is more distinct; while the ectostracum appears
made up of very thin laminæ, and the tubes are represented
by delicate striæ, which appear coarser in the
region of the dark zones. As in the naturally soft parts
of the exoskeleton, the decalcified cuticle may be split
into flakes, and the pores are then seen to be disposed
in distinct areæ circumscribed by clear polygonal borders.
These perforated areæ appear to correspond with individual
cells of the ectoderm, and the canals thus answer
to the so-called “pore-canals,” which are common in
cuticular structures and in the walls of many cells
which
bound free surfaces. <span class="xxpn" id="p196">{196}</span></p>

<p>The whole exoskeleton of the crayfish is, in fact,
produced by the cells which underlie it, either by the
exudation of a chitinous substance, which subsequently
hardens, from them; or, as is more probable, by the
chemical metamorphosis of a superficial zone of the
bodies of the cells into chitin. However this may be,
the cuticular products of adjacent cells at first form a
simple, continuous, thin pellicle. A continuation of the
process by which it was originated increases the thickness
of the cuticle; but the material thus added to the
inner surface of the latter is not always of the same
nature, but is alternately denser and softer. The denser
material gives rise to the tough laminæ, the softer to
the intermediate transparent substance. But the quantity
of the latter is at first very small, whence the more
external laminæ are in close apposition. Subsequently
the quantity of the intermediate substance increases, and
gives rise to the thick stratification of the middle region,
while it remains insignificant in the inner region of the
exoskeleton.</p>

<p>The cuticular structures of the crayfish differ from
the nails, hairs, hoofs, and similar hard parts of the
higher animals, insomuch as the latter consist of aggregations
of cells, the bodies of which have been metamorphosed
into horny matter. The cuticle, with all its
dependencies, on the contrary, though no less dependent
on cells for its existence, is a derivative product, the
formation of which does not
involve the complete <span class="xxpn" id="p197">{197}</span>
metamorphosis and consequent destruction of the cells to
which it owes its origin.</p>

<p>The calcareous salts by which the calcified exoskeleton
is hardened can only be supplied by the infiltration of a
fluid in which they are dissolved from the blood; while
the distinctive structural characters of the epiostracum,
the ectostracum, and the endostracum, are the results of
a process of metamorphosis which goes on <i>pari passu</i> with
this infiltration. To what extent this metamorphosis is
a properly vital process; and to what extent it is explicable
by the ordinary physical and chemical properties of
the animal membrane on the one hand, and the mineral
salts on the other, is a curious, and at present, unsolved
problem.</p>

<p>The outer surface of the cuticle is rarely smooth.
Generally it is more or less obviously ridged or tuberculated;
and, in addition, presents coarser or finer hair-like
processes which exhibit every gradation from a fine
microscopic down to stout spines. As these processes,
though so similar to hairs in general appearance, are
essentially different from the structures known as hairs
in the higher animals, it is better to speak of them as
<i>setæ</i>.</p>

<p>These setæ (fig.
<a href="#f56" title="go to &#x66;ig. 56">56</a>, F) are sometimes short, slender,
conical filaments, the surface of which is quite smooth;
sometimes the surface is produced into minute serrations,
or scale-like prominences, disposed in two or more
series; in other setæ, the axis gives
off slender lateral <span class="xxpn" id="p198">{198}</span>
branches; and in the most complicated form the branches
are ornamented with lateral branchlets. For a certain
distance from the base of the seta, its surface is usually
smooth, even when the rest of its extent is ornamented
with scales or branches. Moreover, the basal part of the
seta is marked off from its apical moiety by a sort of
joint which is indicated by a slight constriction, or by a
peculiarity in the structure of the cuticula at this point.
A seta almost always takes its origin from the bottom of
a depression or pit of the layer of cuticle, from which it is
developed, and at its junction with the latter it is generally
thin and flexible, so that the seta moves easily in its
socket. Each seta contains a cavity, the boundaries of
which generally follow the outer contours of the seta. In
a good many of the setæ, however, the parietes, near the
base of the seta, are thickened in such a manner as
almost, or completely, to obliterate the central cavity.
However thick the cuticle may be at the point from
which the setæ take their origin, it is always traversed
by a funnel-shaped canal (fig.
<a href="#f56" title="go to &#x66;ig. 56">56</a>, B, <i>d</i>), which usually
expands beneath the base of the seta. Through this
canal the subjacent ectoderm extends up to the base of
the seta, and can even be traced for some distance into
its interior.</p>

<p>It has already been mentioned that the apodemata and
the tendons of the muscles are infoldings of the cuticle,
embraced and secreted by corresponding involutions of
the ectoderm. <span class="xxpn" id="p199">{199}</span></p>

<p>Thus the body of the crayfish is resolvable, in the first
place, into a repetition of similar segments, the <i>metameres</i>,
each of which consists of a somite and two appendages;
the metameres are built up out of a few simple <i>tissues</i>;
and, finally, the tissues are either aggregates of more or
less modified nucleated <i>cells</i>, or are products of such cells.
Hence, in ultimate morphological analysis, the crayfish
is a multiple of the histological unit, the nucleated cell.</p>

<p>What is true of the crayfish, is certainly true of all
animals, above the very lowest. And it cannot yet be considered
certain that the generalization fails to hold good
even of the simplest manifestations of animal life; since
recent investigations have demonstrated the presence of
a nucleus in organisms in which it had hitherto appeared
to be absent.</p>

<p>However this may be, there is no doubt that in the
case of man and of all vertebrated animals, in that
of all arthropods, mollusks, echinoderms, worms, and
inferior organisms down to the very lowest sponges, the
process of morphological analysis yields the same result
as in the case of the crayfish. The body is built up of
tissues, and the tissues are either obviously composed of
nucleated cells; or, from the presence of nuclei, they
may be assumed to be the results of the metamorphosis
of such cells; or they are cuticular structures.</p>

<p>The essential character of the nucleated cell is that it
consists of a protoplasmic substance, one part of which
differs somewhat in its physical
and chemical characters <span class="xxpn" id="p200">{200}</span>
from the rest, and constitutes the nucleus. What part
the nucleus plays in relation to the functions, or vital
activities, of the cell is as yet unknown; but that it is
the seat of operations of a different character from those
which go on in the body of the cell is clear enough.
For, as we have seen, however different the several
tissues may be, the nuclei which they contain are very
much alike; whence it follows, that if all these tissues
were primitively composed of simple nucleated cells, it
must be the bodies of the cells which have undergone
metamorphosis, while the nuclei have remained relatively
unchanged.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when cells multiply, as they do
in all growing parts, by the division of one cell into two,
the signs of the process of internal change which ends
in fission are apparent in the nucleus before they are
manifest in the body of the cell; and, commonly, the
division of the former precedes that of the latter. Thus
a single cell body may possess two nuclei, and may become
divided into two cells by the subsequent aggregation
of the two moieties of its protoplasmic substance
round each of them, as a centre.</p>

<p>In some cases, very singular structural changes take
place in the nuclei in the course of the process of cell-division.
The granular or fibrillar contents of the
nucleus, the wall of which becomes less distinct, arrange
themselves in the form of a spindle or double cone,
formed of extremely delicate filaments; and
in the plane <span class="xxpn" id="p201">{201}</span>
of the base of the double cone the filaments present knots
or thickenings, just as if they were so many threads with
a bead in the middle of each. When the nuclear spindle
is viewed sideways, these beads or thickenings give rise
to the appearance of a disk traversing the centre of the
spindle. Soon each bead separates into two, and these
move away from one another, but remain connected by a
fine filament. Thus the structure which had the form of
a double cone, with a disk in the middle, assumes that of
a short cylinder, with a disk and a cone at each end. But
as the distance between the two disks increases, the
uniting filaments lose their parallelism, converge in the
middle, and finally separate, so that two separate double
cones are developed in place of the single one. Along
with these changes in the nucleus, others occur in the
protoplasm of the cell body, and its parts commonly display
a tendency to arrange themselves in radii from the
extremities of the cones as a centre; while, as the separation
of the two secondary nuclear spindles becomes complete,
the cell body gradually splits from the periphery
inwards, in a direction at right angles to the common
axis of the spindles and between their apices. Thus
two cells are formed, where, previously, only one existed;
and the nuclear spindles of each soon revert to the
globular form and confused arrangement of the contents,
characteristic of nuclei in their ordinary state.
The formation of these nuclear spindles is very beautifully
seen in the epithelial cells of the
testis of the <span class="xxpn" id="p202">{202}</span>
crayfish (fig. <a href="#f33" title="go to &#x66;ig. 33">33</a>, p. 132); but I have not been able to find
distinct evidence of it elsewhere in this animal; and
although the process has now been proved to take place
in all the divisions of the animal kingdom, it would seem
that nuclei may, and largely do, undergo division, without
becoming converted into spindles.</p>

<p>The most cursory examination of any of the higher
plants shows that the vegetable, like the animal body,
is made up of various kinds of tissues, such as pith,
woody fibre, spiral vessels, ducts, and so on. But even
the most modified forms of vegetable tissue depart so
little from the type of the simple cell, that the reduction
of them all to that common type is suggested still more
strongly than in the case of the animal fabric. And
thus the nucleated cell appears to be the morphological
unit of the plant no less than of the animal. Moreover,
recent inquiry has shown that in the course of the
multiplication of vegetable cells by division, the nuclear
spindles may appear and run through all their remarkable
changes by stages precisely similar to those which
occur in animals.</p>

<p>The question of the universal presence of nuclei in
cells may be left open in the case of Plants, as in that
of Animals; but, speaking generally, it may justly be
affirmed that the nucleated cell is the morphological
foundation of both divisions of the living world; and
the great generalisation of Schleiden and Schwann,
that there is a fundamental agreement
in structure and <span class="xxpn" id="p203">{203}</span>
development between plants and animals, has, in substance,
been merely confirmed and illustrated by the
labours of the half century which has elapsed since its
promulgation.</p>

<p>Not only is it true that the minute structure of the
crayfish is, in principle, the same as that of any other
animal, or of any plant, however different it may be in
detail; but, in all animals (save some exceptional forms)
above the lowest, the body is similarly composed of
three layers, ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, disposed
around a central alimentary cavity. The ectoderm
and the endoderm always retain their epithelial character;
while the mesoderm, which is insignificant in the lower
organisms, becomes, in the higher, far more complicated
even than it is in the crayfish.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the whole of the <i>Arthropoda</i>, and the
whole of the <i>Vertebrata</i>, to say nothing of other groups
of animals, the body, as in the crayfish, is susceptible
of distinction into a series of more or less numerous
segments, composed of homologous parts. In each
segment these parts are modified according to physiological
requirements; and by the coalescence, segregation,
and change of relative size and position of the
segments, well characterized regions of the body are
marked out. And it is remarkable that precisely the
same principles are illustrated by the morphology of
plants. A flower with its whorls of sepals, petals,
stamens and carpels has the same relation
to a stem <span class="xxpn" id="p204">{204}</span>
with its whorls of leaves, as a crayfish’s head has to its
abdomen, or a dog’s skull to its thorax.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>It may be objected, however, that the morphological
generalisations which have now been reached, are to a
considerable extent of a speculative character; and that, in
the case of our crayfish, the facts warrant no more than
the assertion that the structure of that animal may be
consistently interpreted, on the supposition that the body
is made up of homologous somites and appendages, and
that the tissues are the result of the modification of
homologous histological elements or cells; and the objection
is perfectly valid.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that blood corpuscles, liver
cells, and ova are all nucleated cells; nor any that the
third, fourth, and fifth somites of the abdomen are constructed
upon the same plan; for these propositions are
mere statements of the anatomical facts. But when, from
the presence of nuclei in connective tissue and muscles,
we conclude that these tissues are composed of modified
cells; or when we say that the ambulatory limbs of the
thorax are of the same type as the abdominal limbs, the
exopodite being suppressed, the statement, as the evidence
stands at present, is no more than a convenient
way of interpreting the facts. The question remains,
has the muscle actually been formed out of nucleated
cells? Has the ambulatory limb ever possessed an
exopodite,
and lost it? <span class="xxpn" id="p205">{205}</span></p>

<p>The answer to these questions is to be sought in the
facts of individual and ancestral development.</p>

<p>An animal not only is, but becomes; the crayfish is the
product of an egg, in which not a single structure visible
in the adult animal exists: in that egg the different tissues
and organs make their appearance by a gradual process of
evolution; and the study of this process can alone tell
us whether the unity of composition suggested by the
comparison of adult structures, is borne out by the facts
of their development in the individual or not. The
hypothesis that the body of the crayfish is made up of a
series of homologous somites and appendages, and that
all the tissues are composed of nucleated cells, might be
only a permissible, because a useful, mode of colligating
the facts of anatomy. The investigation of the actual
manner in which the evolution of the body of the crayfish
has been effected, is the only means of ascertaining
whether it is anything more. And, in this sense, development
is the criterion of all morphological speculations.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The first obvious change which takes place in an impregnated
ovum is the breaking up of the yelk into
smaller portions, each of which is provided with a nucleus,
and is termed a <i>blastomere</i>. In a general morphological
sense, a blastomere is a nucleated cell, and differs from
an ordinary cell only in size, and in the usual, though by
no means invariable, abundance of granular contents;
and blastomeres insensibly pass into
ordinary cells, as <span class="xxpn" id="p206">{206}</span>
the process of division of the yelk into smaller and
smaller portions goes on.</p>

<p>In a great many animals, the splitting-up into blastomeres
is effected in such a manner that the yelk is, at
first, divided into equal, or nearly equal, masses; that
each of these again divides into two; and that the number
of blastomeres thus increases in geometrical progression
until the entire yelk is converted into a mulberry-like
body, termed a <i>morula</i>, made up of a great number
of small blastomeres or nucleated cells. The whole
organism is subsequently built up by the multiplication,
the change of position, and the metamorphosis of these
products of yelk division.</p>

<p>In such a case as this, yelk division is said to be
<i>complete</i>. An unessential modification of complete yelk
division is seen when, at an early period, the blastomeres
produced by division are of unequal sizes; or when they
become unequal in consequence of division taking place
much more rapidly in one set than in another.</p>

<p>In many animals, especially those which have large
ova, the inequality of division is pushed so far that only
a portion of the yelk is affected by the process of fission,
while the rest serves merely as <i>food-yelk</i>, for nutriment
to the blastomeres thus produced. Over a greater or
less extent of the surface of the egg, the protoplasmic
substance of the yelk segregates itself from the rest,
and, constituting a <i>germinal layer</i>, breaks up into the
blastomeres, which multiply at the
expense of the <span class="xxpn" id="p207">{207}</span>
food-yelk, and fabricate the body of the embryo. This process
is termed <i>partial</i> or <i>incomplete</i> yelk division.</p>

<p>The crayfish is one of those animals in the egg of
which the yelk undergoes partial division. The first
steps of the process have not yet been thoroughly worked
out, but their result is seen in ova which have been but
a short time laid (fig.
<a href="#f57" title="go to &#x66;ig. 57">57</a>, A). In such eggs, the great
mass of the substance of the vitellus is destined to play
the part of food-yelk; and it is disposed in conical
masses, which radiate from a central spheroidal portion
to the periphery of the yelk (<i>v</i>). Corresponding with the
base of each cone, there is a clear protoplasmic plate,
which contains a nucleus; and as these bodies are all
in contact by their edges, they form a complete, though
thin, investment to the food-yelk. This is termed the
<i>blastoderm</i> (<i>bl</i>).</p>

<p>Each nucleated protoplasmic plate adheres firmly to
the corresponding cone of granular food-yelk, and, in all
probability, the two together represent a blastomere;
but, as the cones only indirectly subserve the growth of
the embryo, while the nucleated peripheral plates form
an independent spherical sac, out of which the body of
the young crayfish is gradually fashioned, it will be convenient
to deal with the latter separately.</p>

archenteron, or mid-gut; <i>v</i>, yelk. The dotted
portions in D and E represent the nervous system.</div></div>

<p>Thus, at this period, the body of the developing crayfish
is nothing but a spherical bag, the thin walls of which are
composed of a single layer of nucleated cells, while its
cavity is filled with food-yelk.
The first modification <span class="xxpn" id="p209">{209}</span>
which is effected in the vesicular blastoderm manifests
itself on that face of it which is turned towards the pedicle
of the egg. Here the layer of cells becomes thickened
throughout an oval area about 1‐25th of an inch in
diameter. Hence, when the egg is viewed by reflected
light, a whitish patch of corresponding form and size
appears in this region. This may be termed the <i>germinal
disk</i>. Its long axis corresponds with that of the
future crayfish.</p>

<p>Next, a depression (fig.
<a href="#f58" title="go to &#x66;ig. 58">58</a>, A, <i>bp</i>) appears in the hinder
third of the germinal disk, in consequence of this part
of the blastoderm growing inwards, and thus giving rise
to a small wide-mouthed pouch, which projects into the
food-yelk with which the cavity of the blastoderm is
filled (fig.
<a href="#f57" title="go to &#x66;ig. 57">57</a>, B, <i>mg</i>). As this infolding, or invagination
of the blastoderm, goes on, the pouch thus produced
increases, while its external opening, termed the <i>blastopore</i>
(fig.
<a href="#f57" title="go to &#x66;ig. 57">57</a>, B, and 58, A–E, <i>bp</i>), diminishes in size.
Thus the body of the embryo crayfish, from being a
simple bag becomes a double bag, such as might be
produced by pushing in the wall of an incompletely
distended india-rubber ball with the finger. And, in
this case, if the interior of the bag contained porridge,
the latter would very fairly represent the food-yelk.</p>

<p>By this invagination a most important step has
been taken in the development of the crayfish. For,
though the pouch is nothing but an ingrowth of part of
the blastoderm, the cells of which its
wall is composed <span class="xxpn" id="p211">{211}</span>
henceforward exhibit different tendencies from those
which are possessed by the rest of the blastoderm. In
fact, it is the primitive alimentary apparatus or <i>archenteron</i>,
and its wall is termed the <i>hypoblast</i>. The rest of
the blastoderm, on the contrary, is the primitive epidermis,
and receives the name of <i>epiblast</i>. If the food-yelk
were away, and the archenteron enlarged until the
hypoblast came in contact with the epiblast, the entire
body would be a double-walled sac, containing an alimentary
cavity, with a single external aperture. This is
the <i>gastrula</i> condition of the embryo; and some animals,
such as the common fresh-water polype, are little more
than permanent <i>gastrulæ</i>.</p>

<p>Although the gastrula has not the slightest resemblance
to a crayfish, yet, as soon as the hypoblast and
the epiblast are thus differentiated, the foundations of
some of the most important systems of organs of the
future crustacean are laid. The hypoblast will give rise
to the epithelial lining of the mid-gut; the epiblast
(which answers to the ectoderm in the adult) to the
epithelia of the fore-gut and hind-gut, to the epidermis,
and to the central nervous system.</p>

<p>The mesodermal structures, that is to say the connective
tissue, the muscles, the heart and vessels, and
the reproductive organs, which lie between the ectoderm
and the endoderm, are not derived directly from either
the epiblast or the hypoblast, but have a <i>quasi</i>-independent
origin, from a mass of cells which
first makes its <span class="xxpn" id="p212">{212}</span>
appearance in the neighbourhood of the blastopore, between the
hypoblast and the epiblast, though they are probably
derived from the former. From this region they gradually
spread, first over the sternal, and then on to the
tergal aspect of the embryo, and constitute the <i>mesoblast</i>.</p>

<p>Epiblast, hypoblast, and mesoblast are at first alike
constituted of nothing but nucleated cells, and they increase
in dimensions by the continual fission and growth
of these cells. The several layers become gradually
modelled into the organs which they constitute, before
the cells undergo any notable modification into tissues.
A limb, for example, is, at first, a mere cellular outgrowth,
or bud, composed of an outer coat of epiblast
with an inner core of mesoblast; and it is only subsequently
that its component cells are metamorphosed into
well-defined epidermic and connective tissues, vessels and
muscles.</p>

<p>The embryo crayfish remains only a short while in
the gastrula stage, as the blastopore soon closes up, and
the archenteron takes the form of a sac, flattened out
between the epiblast and the food-yelk, with which its
cells are in close contact (fig.
<a href="#f57" title="go to &#x66;ig. 57">57</a>, C and D).<a class="afnanc" href="#fn12" id="fnanc12">12</a>
Indeed, as
development proceeds, the cells of the hypoblast actually
feed upon the substance of the food-yelk, and turn it to
account for the general nutrition
of the body. <span class="xxpn" id="p213">{213}</span></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc12" id="fn12">12</a>
Whether, as some observers state, the hypoblastic cells grow over
and inclose the food-yelk or not, is a question that may be left open. I
have not been able to satisfy myself of this fact.</p></div>

<p>The sternal area of the embryo gradually enlarges
until it occupies one hemisphere of the yelk; in other
words, the thickening of the epiblast gradually extends
outwards. Just in front of the blastopore, as it closes,
the middle of the epiblast grows out into a rounded
elevation (fig.
<a href="#f58" title="go to &#x66;ig. 58">58</a>, <i>t&#x202f;a</i>; fig.
<a href="#f59" title="go to &#x66;ig. 59">59</a>, <i>ab</i>), which rapidly increases
in length, and at the same time turns forwards. This
is the rudiment of the whole abdomen of the crayfish.
Further forwards, two broad and elongated, but flatter
thickenings appear; one on each side of the middle line
(fig.
<a href="#f58" title="go to &#x66;ig. 58">58</a>, <i>p&#x202f;c</i>). As the free end of the abdominal papilla
now marks the hinder extremity of the embryo, so do
these two elevations, which are termed the <i>procephalic
lobes</i>, define its anterior termination. The whole sternal
region of the body will be produced by the elongation of
that part of the embryo which lies between these two
limits.</p>

<p>A narrow longitudinal groove-like depression appears
on the surface of the epiblast, in the middle line, between
the procephalic lobes and the base of the abdominal
papilla (fig.
<a href="#f58" title="go to &#x66;ig. 58">58</a>, C–F, <i>m&#x202f;g</i>). About its centre, this groove
becomes further depressed by the ingrowth of the epiblast,
which constitutes its floor, and gives rise to a
short tubular sac, which is the rudiment of the whole fore-gut
(fig.
<a href="#f57" title="go to &#x66;ig. 57">57</a>, C, and fig.
<a href="#f58" title="go to &#x66;ig. 58">58</a>, E, <i>f&#x202f;g</i>). At first, this epiblastic
ingrowth does not communicate with the archenteron, but,
after a while, its blind end combines with the front and
lower part of the hypoblast, and an opening
is formed by <span class="xxpn" id="p214">{214}</span>
which the cavity of the fore-gut communicates with that
of the mid-gut (fig.
<a href="#f57" title="go to &#x66;ig. 57">57</a>, E). Thus a gullet and stomach,
or rather the parts which will eventually give rise to all
these, are constituted. And it is important to remark
that, in comparison with the mid-gut, they are, at first,
very small.</p>

<p>In the same way, the epiblast covering the sternal face
of the abdominal papilla undergoes invagination and is
converted into a narrow tube which is the origin of the
whole hind-gut (fig.
<a href="#f57" title="go to &#x66;ig. 57">57</a>, C, and fig.
<a href="#f58" title="go to &#x66;ig. 58">58</a>, E, <i>hg</i>). This, like
the fore-gut, is at first blind; but the shut front end soon
applying itself to the hinder wall of the archenteric sac,
the two coalesce and open into one another (fig.
<a href="#f57" title="go to &#x66;ig. 57">57</a>, E).
Thus the complete alimentary canal, consisting of a very
narrow, tubular, fore- and hind-gut, derived from the
epiblast, and a wider and more sac-like mid-gut, formed
of the whole hypoblast, is constituted.</p>

<p>The procephalic lobes become more convex; while,
behind them, the surface of the epiblast rises into six
elevations disposed in pairs, one on each side of the
median groove. The hindermost of these, which lie at
the sides of the mouth, are the rudiments of the
mandibles (fig.
<a href="#f58" title="go to &#x66;ig. 58">58</a>, E and F, <i>4</i>); the other two become
the antennæ (<i>3</i>) and the antennules (<i>2</i>), while, at a later
period, processes of the procephalic lobes give rise to the
eyestalks.</p>

<p>A short distance behind the abdomen, the epiblast
rises into a transverse ridge, which
is concave forwards, <span class="xxpn" id="p215">{215}</span>
while its ends are prolonged on each side nearly as far
as the mouth. This is the commencement of the free
edge of the carapace (fig.
<a href="#f58" title="go to &#x66;ig. 58">58</a>, E and F, and fig.
<a href="#f59" title="go to &#x66;ig. 59">59</a>, A, <i>c</i>)—the
lateral parts of which, greatly enlarging, become
the branchiostegites (fig.
<a href="#f59" title="go to &#x66;ig. 59">59</a>, D, <i>c</i>).</p>

<p>In many animals allied to crayfish, the young, when
it has reached a stage in its development, which answers
to this, undergoes rapid changes of outward form and of
internal structure, without making any essential addition
to the number of the appendages. The appendages which
represent the antennules, the antennæ, and the mandibles
elongate and become oar-like locomotive organs; a
single median eye is developed, and the young leaves the
egg as an active larva, which is known as a <i>Nauplius</i>.
The crayfish, on the other hand, is wholly incapable of
an independent existence at this stage, and continues its
embryonic life within the egg case; but it is a remarkable
circumstance that the cells of the epiblast secrete
a delicate cuticula, which is subsequently shed. It is
as if the animal symbolized a nauplius condition by
the development of this cuticle, as the fœtal whalebone
whale symbolizes a toothed condition by developing teeth
which are subsequently lost and never perform any
function.</p>

<i>h</i>, heart; <i>lb</i>, labrum; <i>lr</i>, liver; <i>m</i>, mandibular
muscles.</div></div>

<p>In fact, in the crayfish, the nauplius condition is soon
left behind. The sternal disk spreads more and more
over the yelk; as the region between the mouth and
the root of the abdomen
elongates, slight transverse <span class="xxpn" id="p217">{217}</span>
depressions indicate the boundaries of the posterior
cephalic and the thoracic somites; and pairs of elevations,
similar to the rudiments of the antennules and
antennæ, appear upon them in regular order from before
backwards (fig.
<a href="#f59" title="go to &#x66;ig. 59">59</a>, C).</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the extremity of the abdomen
flattens out and takes on the form of an oval plate,
the middle of the posterior margin of which is slightly
truncated or notched; while, finally, transverse constrictions
mark off six segments, the somites of the abdomen,
in front of this. Along with these changes, four pairs
of tubercles grow out from the sternal faces of the four
middle abdominal somites, and constitute the rudiments
of the four middle pairs of abdominal appendages. The
first abdominal somite exhibits only two hardly perceptible
elevations in place of the appendages of the others,
while the sixth seems, at first, to have none. The appendages
of the sixth somite, however, are already formed,
though, singularly enough, they lie beneath the cuticle
of the telson and are set free only after the first
ecdysis.</p>

<p>The rostrum grows out between the procephalic lobes;
it remains relatively very short up to the time that the
young crayfish quits the egg, and is directed more downwards
than forwards. The lateral portions of the carapacial
ridge, becoming deeper, are converted into the
branchiostegites, and the cavities which they overarch
are the branchial chambers. The
transverse portion of <span class="xxpn" id="p218">{218}</span>
the ridge, on the other hand, remains relatively short, and
constitutes the free posterior margin of the carapace.</p>

<p>As these changes take place, the abdomen and the
sternal region of the thorax are constantly enlarging in
proportion to the rest of the ovum; and the food-yelk
which lies in the cephalothorax is, <i>pari passu</i>, being
diminished. Hence the cephalothorax constantly becomes
relatively smaller and the tergal aspect of the carapace
less spherical; although, even when the young crayfish
is ready to be hatched, the difference between it and the
adult in the form of the cephalothoracic region, and in the
size of the latter relatively to the abdomen, is very marked.</p>

<p>The simple bud-like outgrowths of the somites, in
which all the appendages take their origin, are rapidly
metamorphosed. The eyestalks (fig.
<a href="#f59" title="go to &#x66;ig. 59">59</a>, <i>1</i>) soon attain
a considerable relative size. The extremities of the
antennules (<i>2</i>) and of the antennæ (<i>3</i>) become bifurcated;
and the two divisions of the antennule remain broad,
thick, and of nearly the same size up to birth. On the
other hand, the inner or endopoditic division of the
antenna becomes immensely lengthened, and at the same
time annulated, while the outer or exopoditic division
remains relatively short, and acquires its characteristic
scale-like form.</p>

<p>The labrum (<i>lb</i>) arises as a prolongation of the middle
sternal region in front of the mouth, while the bilobed
metastoma is an outgrowth of the sternal region behind
it. <span class="xxpn" id="p219">{219}</span></p>

<p>The posterior cephalic and the thoracic appendages
(<i>5–14</i>) elongate and gradually approach the form which
they possess in the adult. I have not been able to
discover, at any period of development, an outer division
or exopodite in any of the five posterior thoracic limbs.
And this is a very remarkable circumstance, inasmuch
as such an exopodite exists in the closely allied lobster
in the larval state; and, in many of the shrimp and
prawn-like allies of the crayfish, a complete or rudimentary
exopodite is found in these limbs, even in the
adult condition.</p>

<p>When the crayfish is hatched (fig. <a href="#f60"
title="go to &#x66;ig. 60">60</a>) it differs from the
adult in many ways—not only is the cephalothorax more
convex and larger in proportion to the abdomen; but
the rostrum is short and bent down between the eyes.
The sterna of the thorax are wider relatively, and
hence there is a greater interval between the bases
of the legs than in the adult. The proportion of the
limbs to one another and to the body are nearly the
same as in the adult, but the chelæ of the forceps
are more slender. The tips of the chelæ are all
strongly incurved (fig. <a href="#f08" title="go to
&#x66;ig. 8">8</a>, B, p. 41), and the dactylopodites
of the two posterior thoracic limbs are hook-like.
The appendages of the first abdominal somite are
undeveloped, and those of the last are inclosed within
the telson, which is, as has already been said, of
a broad oval form, usually notched in the middle of
its hinder margin, and devoid of any indication of
transverse division. Its margins are produced into
a single series of short conical <span class="xxpn"
id="p220">{220}</span> processes, and the disposition
of the vascular canals in its interior gives it the
appearance of being radially striated.</p>

<p>The setæ, so abundant in the adult, are very scanty in
the newly hatched young; and the great majority of those
which exist are simple conical prolongations of the uncalcified
cuticle, the bases of which are not sunk in pits
and which are devoid of lateral scales or processes.</p>

<div class="dcaption">
<span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span> 60.—<i>Astacus
fluviatilis.</i>—Newly-hatched young (×&#x202f;6).</div></div>

<p>The young animals are firmly attached to the abdominal
appendages of the parent in the manner already
described. They are very sluggish, though they move
when touched; and at this period they do
not feed, but <span class="xxpn" id="p221">{221}</span>
are nourished by the food-yelk, of which a considerable
store still remains in the cephalothorax.</p>

<p>I imagine that they are set free during the first ecdysis,
and that the appendages of the sixth abdominal somite
are at that time expanded, but nothing is definitely known
at present of these changes.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The foregoing sketch of the general nature of the
changes which take place in the egg of the crayfish
suffice to show that its development is, in the strictest
sense of the word, a process of evolution. The egg is
a relatively homogeneous mass of living protoplasmic
matter, containing much nutritive material; and the
development of the crayfish means the gradual conversion
of this comparatively simple body into an organism
of great complexity. The yelk becomes differentiated
into formative and nutritive portions. The formative
portion is subdivided into histological units: these
arrange themselves into a blastodermic vesicle; the blastoderm
becomes differentiated into epiblast, hypoblast,
and mesoblast; and the simple vesicle assumes the gastrula
condition. The layers of the gastrula shape themselves
into the body of the crayfish and its appendages,
while along with this, the cells of which all the parts
are built, become metamorphosed into tissues, each with
its characteristic properties. And all these wonderful
changes are the necessary consequences of the interaction
of the molecular forces resident in the
substance of the <span class="xxpn" id="p222">{222}</span>
impregnated ovum, with the conditions to which it is
exposed; just as the forms evolved from a crystallising
fluid are dependent upon the chemical composition of
the dissolved matter and the influence of surrounding
conditions.</p>

<p>Without entering into details which lie beyond the
scope of the present work, something must be said respecting
the manner in which the complicated internal
organisation of the crayfish is evolved from the cellular
double sac of the gastrula stage.</p>

<p>It has been seen that the fore-gut is at first an
insignificant tubular involution of the epiblast in
the region of the mouth. It is, in fact, a part of the
epiblast turned inwards, and the cells of which it is
composed secrete a thin cuticular layer, as do those
of the rest of the epiblast, which gives rise to the
ectodermal or epidermic part of the integument. As
the embryo grows, the fore-gut enlarges much faster
than the mid-gut, increasing in height and from before
backwards, while its side-walls remain parallel, and
are separated by only a narrow cavity. At length, it
takes on the shape of a triangular bag (fig.
<a href="#f57" title="go to &#x66;ig. 57">57</a>, D,
<i>fg</i>), attached by its narrow end around the mouth
and immersed in the food-yelk, which it gradually
divides into two lobes, one on the right and one on
the left side. At the same time a vertical plate of
mesoblastic tissue, from which the great anterior and
posterior muscles are eventually developed, connects
it with the roof and with the front wall of the
carapace. <span class="xxpn" id="p223">{223}</span>
Becoming constricted in the middle, the fore-gut
next appears to consist of two dilatations of about
equal size, connected by a narrower passage (fig.
<a href="#f57" title="go to &#x66;ig. 57">57</a>,
E, <i>fg</i><sup>1</sup>, <i>fg</i><sup>2</sup>). The front
dilatation becomes the œsophagus and the cardiac
division of the stomach; the hinder one, the pyloric
division. At the sides of the front end of the cardiac
division two small pouches are formed shortly after
birth; in each of these a thick laminated deposit
of chitin takes place, and constitutes a minute
crab’s-eye or gastrolith, which has the same structure
as in the adult, and is largely calcified. This
fact is the more remarkable as, at this time, the
exoskeleton contains very little calcareous deposit.
In the position of the gastric teeth, folds of the
cellular wall of corresponding shape are formed, and
the chitinous cuticle of which the teeth are composed
is, as it were, modelled upon them.</p>

<p>The hind-gut occupies the whole length of the abdomen,
and its cells early arrange themselves into six
ridges, and secrete a cuticular layer.</p>

<p>The mid-gut, or hypoblastic sac, very soon gives off
numerous small prolongations on each side of its hinder
extremity, and these are converted into the cæca of the
liver (fig.
<a href="#f57" title="go to &#x66;ig. 57">57</a>, E, <i>mg</i>). The cells of its tergal wall are in
close contact with the adjacent masses of food-yelk; and
it is probable that the gradual absorption of the food-yelk
is chiefly effected by these cells. At birth, however,
the lateral lobes of the food-yelk are still large, and
occupy the space left between the
stomach and liver <span class="xxpn" id="p224">{224}</span>
on the one hand, and the cephalic integument on the
other.</p>

<p>The mesoblastic cells give rise to the layer of connective
tissue which forms the deeper portion of the
integument, and to that which invests the alimentary
canal; to all the muscles; and to the heart, the vessels,
and the corpuscles of the blood. The heart appears
very early as a solid mass of mesoblastic cells in the
tergal region of the thorax, just in front of the origin
of the abdomen (figs.
<a href="#f57" title="go to &#x66;ig. 57">57</a>,
<a href="#f58" title="go to &#x66;ig. 58">58</a>,
<a href="#f59" title="go to &#x66;ig. 59">59</a>, <i>h</i>). It soon becomes
hollow, and its walls exhibit rhythmical contractions.</p>

<p>The branchiæ are, at first, simple papillæ of the integument
of the region from which they take their rise.
These papillæ elongate into stems, which give off lateral
filaments. The podobranchiæ are at first similar to the
arthrobranchiæ, but an outgrowth soon takes place near
the free end of the stem, and becomes the lamina, while
the attached end enlarges into the base.</p>

<p>The renal organ is stated to arise by a tubular involution
of the epiblast, which soon becomes convoluted, and
gives rise to the green gland.</p>

<p>The central nervous system is wholly a product of the
epiblast. The cells which lie at the sides of the longitudinal
groove already mentioned (fig.
<a href="#f58" title="go to &#x66;ig. 58">58</a>, <i>mg</i>), grow inwards,
and give rise to two cords which are at first
separate from one another and continuous with the rest
of the epiblast. At the front end of
the groove a <span class="xxpn" id="p225">{225}</span>
depression arises, and its cells form a mass which connects
these two cords in front of the mouth, and gives
rise to the cerebral ganglia. The epiblastic linings of
two small pits (fig.
<a href="#f58" title="go to &#x66;ig. 58">58</a>, <i>o</i>) which appear very early on the
surface of the procephalic lobes, are also carried inwards
in the same way, and, uniting with the foregoing,
produce the optic ganglia.</p>

<p>The cells of the longitudinal cords become differentiated
into nerve fibres and nerve cells, and the latter,
gathering towards certain points, give rise to the ganglia
which eventually unite in the middle line. By degrees,
the ingrowth of epiblastic cells, from which all these structures
are developed, becomes completely separated from
the rest of the epiblast, and is invested by mesoblastic
cells. The central nervous system, therefore, in a crayfish,
as in a vertebrated animal, is at first, as a part of the
ectoderm, morphologically one with the epidermis; and the
deep and protected position which it occupies in the adult
is only a consequence of the mode in which the nervous
portion of the ectoderm grows inwards and becomes
detached from the epidermic portion.</p>

<p>The visual rods of the eye are merely modified cells of
the ectoderm. The auditory sac is formed by an involution
of the ectoderm of the basal joint of the antennule.
At birth it is a shallow wide-mouthed depression, and
contains no otoliths.</p>

<p>Lastly, the reproductive organs result from the segregation
and special modification of cells
of the mesoblast <span class="xxpn" id="p226">{226}</span>
behind the liver. Rathke states that the sexual apertures
are not visible until the young crayfish has attained the
length of an inch; and that the first pair of abdominal
appendages of the male appear still later in the form of
two papillæ, which gradually elongate and take on their
characteristic forms.</p>

THE COMPARATIVE MORPH­OL­O­GY OF THE CRAY­FISH.—THE
STRUC­TURE AND THE DE­VEL­OP­MENT OF THE CRAY­FISH
COM­PARED WITH THOSE OF OTHER LIV­ING
BEINGS.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">Up to this point, our attention has been directed
almost exclusively to the common English crayfish.
Except in so far as the crayfish is dependent for its
maintenance upon other animals, or upon plants, we
might have ignored the existence of all living things
except crayfishes. But, it is hardly necessary to observe,
that innumerable hosts of other forms of life not only
tenant the waters and the dry land, but throng the air;
and that all the crayfishes in the world constitute a hardly
appreciable fraction of its total living population.</p>

<p>Common observation leads us to see that these multitudinous
living beings differ from not-living things in
many ways; and when the analysis of these differences
is pushed as far as we are at present able to carry it, it
shews us that all living beings agree with the crayfish
and differ from not-living things in the same particulars.
Like the crayfish, they are constantly
wasting away by <span class="xxpn" id="p228">{228}</span>
oxidation, and repairing themselves by taking into their
substance the matters which serve them for food; like
the crayfish, they shape themselves according to a definite
pattern of external form and internal structure; like
the crayfish, they give off germs which grow and develop
into the shapes characteristic of the adult. No mineral
matter is maintained in this fashion; nor grows in
the same way; nor undergoes this kind of development;
nor multiplies its kind by any such process of reproduction.</p>

<p>Again, common observation early leads to the discrimination
of living things into two great divisions. Nobody
confounds ordinary animals with ordinary plants,
nor doubts that the crayfish belongs to the former category
and the waterweed to the latter. If a living thing
moves and possesses a digestive receptacle, it is held to
be an animal; if it is motionless and draws its nourishment
directly from the substances which are in contact
with its outer surface, it is held to be a plant. We need
not inquire, at present, how far this rough definition of
the differences which separate animals from plants holds
good. Accepting it for the moment, it is obvious that
the crayfish is unquestionably an animal,—as much an
animal as the vole, the perch, and the pond-snail, which
inhabit the same waters. Moreover, the crayfish has, in
common with these animals, not merely the motor and
digestive powers characteristic of animality, but they all,
like it, possess a complete
alimentary canal; special <span class="xxpn" id="p229">{229}</span>
apparatus for the circulation and the aëration of the blood;
a nervous system with sense-organs; muscles and motor
mechanisms; reproductive organs. Regarded as pieces
of physiological apparatus, there is a striking similarity
between all three. But, as has already been hinted in
the preceding chapter, if we look at them from a purely
morphological point of view, the differences between the
crayfish, the perch, and the pond-snail, appear at first
sight so great, that it may be difficult to imagine that the
plan of structure of the first can have any relation to
that of either of the last two. On the other hand, if the
crayfish is compared with the water-beetle, notwithstanding
wide differences, many points of similarity between
the two will manifest themselves; while, if a small
lobster is set side by side with a crayfish, an unpractised
observer, though he will readily see that the two animals
are somewhat different, may be a long time in making
out the exact nature of the differences.</p>

<p>Thus there are degrees of likeness and unlikeness
among animals, in respect of their outward form and
internal structure, or, in other words, in their morphology.
The lobster is very like a crayfish, the beetle is
remotely like one; the pond-snail and the perch are
extremely unlike crayfishes. Facts of this kind are commonly
expressed in the language of zoologists, by saying
that the lobster and the crayfish are closely allied
forms; that the beetle and the crayfish present a remote
affinity; and that there is no
affinity between the <span class="xxpn" id="p230">{230}</span>
crayfish and the pond-snail, or the crayfish and the
perch.</p>

<p>The exact determination of the resemblances and
differences of animal forms by the comparison of the
structure and the development of one with those of
another, is the business of comparative morphology.
Morphological comparison, fully and thoroughly worked
out, furnishes us with the means of estimating the
position of any one animal in relation to all the
rest; while it shews us with what forms that animal
is nearly, and with what it is remotely, allied: applied
to all animals, it furnishes us with a kind of
map, upon which animals are arranged in the order of
their respective affinities; or a classification, in which
they are grouped in that order. For the purpose of
developing the results of comparative morphology in the
case of the crayfish, it will be convenient to bring together,
in a summary form, those points of form and structure,
many of which have already been referred to and
which characterise it as a separate kind of animal.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Full-grown English crayfishes usually measure about
three inches and a half from the extremity of the rostrum
in front to that of the telson behind. The largest
specimen I have met with measured
four inches.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn13" id="fnanc13">13</a>
The <span class="xxpn" id="p231">{231}</span>
males are commonly somewhat larger, and they almost
always have longer and stronger forceps than the
females. The general colour of the integument varies
from a light reddish-brown to a dark olive-green; and
the hue of the tergal surface of the body and limbs is
always deeper than that of the sternal surface, which is
often light yellowish-green, with more or less red at the
extremities of the forceps. The greenish hue of the
sternal surface occasionally passes into yellow in the
thorax and into blue in the abdomen.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc13" id="fn13">13</a>
The dimensions of crayfishes at successive
ages given at p. <a href="#p031" title="go to &#x70;. 31">31</a>, beginning at the words “By the end
of the year,” refer to the “écrevisse à pieds rouges” of
France; not to the English crayfish, which is
considerably smaller. Doubtless, the
proportional rate of increment is much the same, in the two
kinds; but in the English crayfish it has not been actually
ascertained.</p></div>

<p>The distance from the orbit to the posterior margin of
the carapace is nearly equal to that from the posterior
margin of the carapace to the base of the telson, when
the abdomen is fully extended, but this measurement of
the carapace is commonly greater than that of the abdomen
in the males and less in the females.</p>

<p>The general contour of the carapace (fig.
<a href="#f61" title="go to &#x66;ig. 61">61</a>), without
the rostrum, is that of an oval, truncated at the ends:
the anterior end being narrower than the posterior. Its
surface is evenly arched from side to side. The greatest
breadth of the carapace lies midway between the cervical
groove and its posterior edge. Its greatest vertical depth
is on a level with the transverse portion of the cervical
groove.</p>

<p>The length of the rostrum, measured from the orbit
<span class="xxpn" id="p232">{232}</span>
to its extremity, is greater than half the distance from
the orbit to the cervical groove. It is trihedral in section,
and its free end is slightly curved upwards (fig.
<a href="#f41" title="go to &#x66;ig. 41">41</a>).
It gradually becomes narrower for about three-fourths of
its whole length. At this point it has rather less than
half the width which it has at its base (fig.
<a href="#f61" title="go to &#x66;ig. 61">61</a>, A); and its
raised, granular and sometimes distinctly serrated margins
are produced into two obliquely directed spines, one on
each side. Beyond these, the rostrum rapidly narrows
to a fine point; and this part of the rostrum is equal in
length to the width between the two spines.</p>

<p>The tergal surface of the rostrum is flattened and
slightly excavated from side to side, except in its anterior
half, where it presents a granular or finely serrated
median ridge, which gradually passes into a low
elevation in the posterior half, and, as such, may generally
be traced on to the cephalic region of the carapace.
The inclined sides of the rostrum meet ventrally in a
sharp edge, convex from before backwards; the posterior
half of this edge gives rise to a small, usually bifurcated,
spine, which descends between the eye-stalks (fig.
<a href="#f41" title="go to &#x66;ig. 41">41</a>).
The raised and granulated lateral margins of the rostrum
are continued back on to the carapace for a short distance,
as two linear ridges (fig.
<a href="#f61" title="go to &#x66;ig. 61">61</a>, A). Parallel with each of
these ridges, and close to it, there is another longitudinal
elevation (<i>a, b</i>), the anterior end of which is raised into a
prominent spine (<i>a</i>), which is situated immediately behind
the orbit, and may, therefore, be
termed the <i>post-orbital</i> <span class="xxpn" id="p233">{233}</span>
<i>spine</i>. The elevation itself may be distinguished as the
<i>post-orbital ridge</i>. The flattened surface of this ridge is
marked by a longitudinal depression
or groove. The <span class="xxpn" id="p234">{234}</span>
posterior end of the ridge passes into a somewhat broader
and less marked elevation, the hinder end of which turns
inwards, and then comes to an end at a point midway
between the orbit and the cervical groove. Generally
this hinder elevation appears like a mere continuation
of the post-orbital ridge; but, sometimes, the two are
separated by a distinct depression. I have never seen
any prominent spine upon the posterior elevation, though
it is sometimes minutely spinulose. The post-orbital
ridges of each side, viewed together, give rise to a characteristic
lyrate mark upon the cephalic region of the
carapace.</p>

<p>A faintly marked, curved, linear depression runs from
the hinder end of the post-orbital ridge, at first directly
downwards, and then curves backwards to the cervical
groove. It corresponds with the anterior and inferior
boundary of the attachment of the adductor muscle of
the mandible.</p>

<p>Below the level of this, and immediately behind the
cervical groove, there are usually three spines, arranged
in a series, which follow the cervical groove. The points
of all are directed obliquely forwards, and the lowest is
the largest. Sometimes there is only one prominent
spine, with one or two very small ones; sometimes there
are as many as five of these <i>cervical spines</i>.</p>

<p>The cardiac region is marked out by two grooves which
run backwards from the cervical groove (fig.
<a href="#f61" title="go to &#x66;ig. 61">61</a>, A, <i>c</i>), and
terminate at a considerable distance
from the posterior <span class="xxpn" id="p235">{235}</span>
edge of the carapace. Each groove runs, at first, obliquely
inwards, and then takes a straight course parallel with its
fellow. The area thus defined is termed the <i>areola</i>; its
breadth is equal to about one-third of the total transverse
diameter of the carapace in this region.</p>

<p>No such distinct lines indicate the lateral boundary of
the region in front of the cervical groove which answers
to the stomach. But the middle part of the carapace,
or that which is comprised in the gastric and cardiac
regions, has its surface sculptured in a different way
from the branchiostegites and the lateral regions of the
head. In the former, the surface is excavated by shallow
pits, separated by relatively broad flat-topped ridges;
but, in the latter, the ridges become more prominent,
and take the form of tubercles, the apices of which are
directed forwards. Minute setæ spring from the depressions
between these tubercles.</p>

<p>The branchiostegite has a thickened rim, which is
strongest below and behind (fig.
<a href="#f01" title="go to &#x66;ig. 1">1</a>). The free edge of
this rim is fringed with close-set setæ.</p>

<p>The pleura of the second to the sixth abdominal
somites are broadly lanceolate and obtusely pointed at
their free ends (fig.
<a href="#f61" title="go to &#x66;ig. 61">61</a>, D); the anterior edge is longer
and more convex than the posterior edge. In the females,
the pleura are larger, and are directed more outwards and
less downwards than in the males. The pleura of the
second somite are much larger than the rest, and overlap
the very small pleura of the first somite
(fig.
<a href="#f01" title="go to &#x66;ig. 1">1</a>). The <span class="xxpn" id="p236">{236}</span>
pleura of the sixth somite are narrow, and their posterior
edges are concave.</p>

<p>The pits and setæ of the cuticle which clothes the
tergal surfaces of the abdominal somites are so few and
scattered, that the latter appear almost smooth. In the
telson, however, especially in its posterior division, the
markings are coarser and the setæ more apparent.</p>

<p>The telson (fig.
<a href="#f61" title="go to &#x66;ig. 61">61</a>, G) presents an anterior quadrate division
and a posterior half-oval part, the free curved edge
of which is beset with long setæ, and is sometimes slightly
notched in the middle. The posterior division is freely
movable upon the anterior, in consequence of the thinness
and pliability of the cuticle along a transverse line
which joins the postero-external angles of the anterior
division, each of which is produced into two strong spines,
of which the outer is the longer. The length of the posterior
division of the telson, measured from the middle
of the suture, is equal to, or but very little less than,
that of the anterior division.</p>

<p>On the under side of the head, the basal joints of the
antennules are visible, internal to those of the antennæ,
but the attachment of the latter is behind and below
that of the former (fig.
<a href="#f03" title="go to &#x66;ig. 3">3</a>, A). Behind these, and in
front of the mouth, the epistoma (fig.
<a href="#f39" title="go to &#x66;ig. 39">39</a>, A, II, III)
presents a broad area of a pentagonal form. The posterior
boundary of this area is formed by two thickened
transverse ridges, which meet on the middle line at a
very open angle, the apex of which
is turned forwards. <span class="xxpn" id="p237">{237}</span>
The posterior edges of these ridges are continuous with
the labrum. The anterior margin is produced in the
middle into a <i>fleur de lys</i> shaped process, the summit
of which terminates between the antennules. At the
sides of this process, the anterior margin of the epistoma
is deeply excavated to receive the basal joints of
the antennæ. Following the contours of these excavated
margins, the surface of the epistoma presents two lateral
convexities. The widest and most prominent part of each
of these lies towards the outer edge of the epistoma,
and is produced into a conical spine. Sometimes
there is a second smaller spine beside the principal one.
Between the two convexities lies a triangular median
depressed area.</p>

<p>The distance from the apex of the anterior median
process to the posterior ridge is equal to a little more
than half the width of the epistoma.</p>

<p>The corneal surface of the eye is transversely elongated
and reniform, and its pigment is black. The eye-stalks
are much broader at their bases than at their corneal
ends (fig.
<a href="#f48" title="go to &#x66;ig. 48">48</a>, A). The antennules are about twice as long
as the rostrum. The tergal surface of the trihedral
basal joint of the antennule, on which the eye-stalk rests,
is concave; the outer surface is convex, the inner flat
(figs. <a href="#f26" title="go to &#x66;ig. 26">26</a>, A, and
<a href="#f48" title="go to &#x66;ig. 48">48</a>, B). Near the anterior end of the
sternal edge which separates the two latter faces, there
is a strong curved spine directed forwards (fig.
<a href="#f48" title="go to &#x66;ig. 48">48</a>, B, <i>a</i>).
When the setæ, which proceed from the
outer edge of <span class="xxpn" id="p238">{238}</span>
the auditory aperture and hide it, are removed, it is
seen to be a wide, somewhat triangular cleft, which occupies
the greater part of the hinder half of the tergal
surface of the basal joint (fig.
<a href="#f26" title="go to &#x66;ig. 26">26</a>, A).</p>

<p>The exopodites, or squames, of the antennæ extend as
far as the apex of the rostrum, or even project beyond it,
when they are turned forwards, while they reach to the
commencement of the filament of the endopodite (<i>Frontispiece</i>).
The squame is fully twice as long as it is broad,
with a general convexity of its tergal and concavity of its
sternal surface. The outer edge is straight and thick, the
inner, which is fringed with long setæ, is convex and thin
(fig.
<a href="#f48" title="go to &#x66;ig. 48">48</a>, C). Where these two edges join in front, the
squame is produced into a strong spine. A thick outer
portion of the squame is marked off from the thinner
inner portion by a longitudinal groove on the tergal side,
and by a strong ridge on the sternal side. One or two
small spines generally project from the posterior and
external angle of the squame; but they may be very
small or absent in individual specimens. Close beneath
these, the outer angle of the next joint is produced into
a strong spine. When the abdomen is straightened out,
if the antennæ are turned back as far as they will go
without damage, the ends of their filaments usually reach
the tergum of the third somite of the abdomen (<i>Frontispiece</i>).
I have not observed any difference between the
sexes in this respect.</p>

<p>The inner edge of the ischiopodite
of the third <span class="xxpn" id="p239">{239}</span>
maxillipede is strongly serrated and wider in front than behind
(fig.
<a href="#f44" title="go to &#x66;ig. 44">44</a>); the meropodite possesses four or five spines
in the same region; and there are one or two spines at
the distal end of the carpopodite. When straightened
out, the maxillipedes extend as far as, or even beyond,
the end of the rostrum.</p>

<p>The inner or sternal edge of the ischiopodite of the
forceps is serrated; that of the meropodite presents two
rows of spines, the inner small and numerous, the outer
large and few. There are several strong spines at the
anterior end of the outer or tergal face of this joint. The
carpopodite has two strong spines on its under or sternal
surface, while its sharp inner edge presents many strong
spines. Its upper surface is marked by a longitudinal depression,
and is beset with sharp tubercles. The length
of the propodite, from its base to the extremity of
the fixed claw of the chela, measures rather more than
twice as much as the extreme breadth of its base, the
thickness of which is less than a third of this length
(fig. <a href="#f20" title="go to &#x66;ig. 20">20</a>, p. 93). The external angular process, or fixed
claw, is of the same length as the base, or a little shorter.
Its inner edge is sharp and spinose, and the outer more
rounded and simply tuberculated. The apex of the fixed
claw is produced into a slightly incurved spine. Its
inner edge has a sinuous curvature, convex posteriorly,
concave anteriorly, and bears a series of rounded tubercles,
of which one near the summit of the convexity, and one
near the apex of the claw are
the most prominent. <span class="xxpn" id="p240">{240}</span></p>

<p>The apex of the dactylopodite, like that of the propodite,
is formed by a slightly incurved spine (fig.
<a href="#f20" title="go to &#x66;ig. 20">20</a>), while
its outer, sharper, edge presents a curvature, the inverse
of that of the edge of the fixed claw against which it is
applied. This edge is beset with rounded tubercles, the
most prominent of which are one at the beginning, and
one at the end of the concave posterior moiety of the edge.
When the dactylopodite is brought up to the fixed claw,
these tubercles lie, one in front of and one behind the
chief tubercle of the convexity of the latter. The whole
surface of the propodite and dactylopodite is covered
with minute elevations, those of the upper surface being
much more prominent than those of the lower surface.</p>

<p>The length of the fully extended forceps generally
equals the distance between the posterior margin of the
orbit and the base of the telson, in well characterized
males; and, in individual examples, they are even longer;
while it may not be greater than the distance between
the orbit and the hinder edge of the fourth abdominal
somite, in females; and, in massiveness and strength, the
difference of the forceps in the two sexes is still more
remarkable (fig.
<a href="#f02" title="go to &#x66;ig. 2">2</a>). Moreover there is a good deal of
variation in the form and size of the chelæ in individual
males. The right and left chelæ present no important
differences.</p>

<p>The ischiopodites of the four succeeding thoracic limbs
are devoid of any recurved spines in either sex (<i>Front.</i>,
fig.
<a href="#f46" title="go to &#x66;ig. 46">46</a>). The first pair are the stoutest,
the second the <span class="xxpn" id="p241">{241}</span>
longest: and when the latter are spread out at right
angles to the body, the distance from tip to tip of the dactylopodites
is equal to, or rather greater than, the extreme
length of the body from the apex of the rostrum to the
posterior edge of the telson, in both sexes. In both sexes,
the length of the swimmerets hardly exceeds half the transverse
diameter of the somites to which they are attached.</p>

<p>The exopodites of the appendages of the sixth abdominal
somite (the extreme length of which is rather
greater than that of the telson) are divided into a larger
proximal, and a smaller distal portion
(fig. <a href="#f37" title="go to &#x66;ig. 37">37</a>, F, p. 144).
The latter is about half as long as the former, and has a
rounded free edge, setose like that of the telson. There
is a complete flexible hinge between the two portions,
and the overlapping free edge of the proximal portion,
which is slightly concave, is beset with conical spines,
the outermost of which are the longest. The endopodite
has a spine at the junction of its outer straight edge
with the terminal setose convex edge. A faintly marked
longitudinal median ridge, or keel, ends close to the
margin in a minute spine. The tergal distal edge of
the protopodite is deeply bilobed, and the inner lobe
ends in two spines, while the outer, shorter and broader
lobe, is minutely serrated.</p>

<p>In addition to the characters distinctive of sex, which
have already been fully detailed (pp.
<a href="#p007" title="go to &#x70;. 7">7</a>,
<a href="#p020" title="go to &#x70;. 20">20</a>, and
<a href="#p145" title="go to &#x70;. 145">145</a>), there
is a marked difference in the form of the sterna of the three
posterior thoracic somites between the
males and females. <span class="xxpn" id="p242">{242}</span>
Comparing a male and a female of the same size, the
triangular area between the bases of the penultimate and
ante-penultimate thoracic limbs is considerably broader
at the base in the female. In both sexes, the hinder
part of the penultimate sternum is a rounded transverse
ridge separated by a groove from the anterior part; but
this ridge is much larger and more prominent in the
female than in the male, and it is often obscurely divided
into two lobes by a median depression. Moreover, there
are but few setæ on this region in the female; while, in
the male, the setæ are long and numerous.</p>

<p>The sternum of the last thoracic somite of the female
is divided by a transverse groove into two parts, of which
the posterior, viewed from the sternal aspect, has the
form of a transverse elongated ridge, which narrows to
each end, is moderately convex in the middle, and is
almost free from setæ. In the male, the corresponding
posterior division of the last thoracic sternum is produced
downwards and forwards into a rounded eminence which
gives attachment to a sort of brush of long setæ (fig.
<a href="#f35" title="go to &#x66;ig. 35">35</a>,
p. 136).</p>

<p>The importance of this long enumeration of minute
details<a class="afnanc" href="#fn14" id="fnanc14">14</a>
will appear by and by. It is simply a statement of
the more obvious external characters in which all the
full-grown English crayfishes which have
come under my <span class="xxpn" id="p243">{243}</span>
notice agree. No one of these individual crayfishes was
exactly like the other; and to give an account of any
single crayfish as it existed in nature, its special peculiarities
must be added to the list of characters given above;
which, considered together with the facts of structure
discussed in previous chapters, constitutes a definition,
or diagnosis, of the English kind, or <i>species</i>, of crayfish.
It follows that the species, regarded as the sum of the
morphological characters in question and nothing else,
does not exist in nature; but that it is an abstraction,
obtained by separating the structural characters in which
the actual existences—the individual crayfishes—agree,
from those in which they differ, and neglecting the latter.</p>

<div class="dftnt">

The student of systematic zoology will find
the comparison of a lobster with a crayfish in all the
points mentioned to be an excellent training of the faculty
of observation.</p></div>

<p>A diagram, embodying the totality of the structural
characters thus determined by observation to be common
to all our crayfishes, might be constructed; and it
would be a picture of nothing which ever existed in
nature; though it would serve as a very complete
plan of the structure of all the crayfishes which are to
be found in this country. The morphological definition
of a species is, in fact, nothing but a description of the
plan of structure which characterises all the individuals
of that species.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>California is separated from these islands by a third of the
circumference of the globe, one-half of the interval being
occupied by the broad North Atlantic ocean. The fresh
waters of California, however, contain
crayfishes which are <span class="xxpn" id="p244">{244}</span>
so like our own, that it is necessary to compare the two in
every point mentioned in the foregoing description in
order to estimate the value of the differences which they
present. Thus, to take one of the kinds of crayfishes found
in California, which has been called <i>Astacus nigrescens</i>;
the general structure of the animal may be described in
precisely the same terms as those used for the English
crayfish. Even the branchiæ present no important
difference, except that the rudimentary pleurobranchiæ
are rather more conspicuous; and that there is a third
small one, in front of the two which correspond with those
possessed by the English crayfish.</p>

<p>The Californian crayfish is larger and somewhat differently
coloured, the undersides of the forceps particularly
presenting a red hue. The limbs, and especially the
forceps of the males, are relatively longer; the chelæ of
the forceps have more slender proportions; the areola is
narrower relatively to the transverse diameter of the
carapace (fig.
<a href="#f61" title="go to &#x66;ig. 61">61</a>, C). More definite distinctions are to be
found in the rostrum, which is almost parallel-sided for
two-thirds of its length, then gives off two strong lateral
spines and suddenly narrows to its apex. Behind these
spines, the raised lateral edges of the rostrum present five
or six other spines which diminish in size from before
backwards. The postorbital spine is very prominent,
but the ridge is represented, in front, by the base of this
spine, which is slightly grooved; and behind, by a distinct
spine which is not so strong as
the postorbital spine. <span class="xxpn" id="p245">{245}</span>
There are no cervical spines, and the middle part of
the cervical groove is angulated backwards instead of
being transverse.</p>

<p>The abdominal pleura are narrow, equal-sided, and
acutely pointed in the males (fig.
<a href="#f61" title="go to &#x66;ig. 61">61</a>, F)—slightly
broader, more obtuse, and with
the anterior edges <span class="xxpn" id="p246">{246}</span>
rather more convex than the posterior, in the females.
The tergal surface of the telson is not divided into two
parts by a suture (fig.
<a href="#f61" title="go to &#x66;ig. 61">61</a>, I). The anterior process of
the epistoma is of a broad rhomboidal shape, and there
are no distinct lateral spines.</p>

<p>The squame of the antenna is not so broad relatively
to its length; its inner edge is less convex, and its outer
edge is slightly concave; the outer basal angle is sharp
but not produced into a spine. The opposed edges of
the fixed and movable claws of the chelæ of the forceps
are almost straight and present no conspicuous tubercles.
In the males, the forceps are vastly larger than in the
females, and the two claws of the chelæ are bowed out, so
that a wide interval is left when their apices are applied
together; in the females, the claws are straight and the
edges fit together, leaving no interval. Both the upper and
the under surfaces of the claws are almost smooth. The
median ridge of the endopodite of the sixth abdominal
appendage is more marked, and ends close to the margin
in a small prominent spine.</p>

<p>In the females, the posterior division of the sternum of
the penultimate thoracic somite is prominent and deeply
bilobed; and there are some small differences in form in
the abdominal appendages of the males. More especially,
the rolled inner process of the endopodite of the second
appendage (fig.
<a href="#f62" title="go to &#x66;ig. 62">62</a> F, <i>f</i>) is disposed very obliquely, and
its open mouth is on a level with the base of the jointed
part of the endopodite (<i>g</i>) instead of
reaching almost to <span class="xxpn" id="p247">{247}</span>
the free end of the latter and being nearly parallel with it.
In the first appendage (C), the anterior rolled edge (<i>a</i>)
more closely embraces the posterior (<i>b</i>), and the groove
is more completely converted into a tube.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>It will be observed that the differences between the
English and the Californian crayfishes amount to exceedingly
little; but, on the assumption that these differences
are constant, and that no transitional forms between
the English and the Californian crayfishes are to be
met with, the individuals which present the characteristic
peculiarities of the latter are said to form a distinct species,
<i>Astacus nigrescens</i>; and the definition of that species is,
like that of the English species, a morphological abstraction,
embodying an account of the plan of that species,
so far as it is distinct from that of other crayfishes.</p>

<p>We shall see by and by that there are sundry other
kinds of crayfishes, which differ no more from the English
or the Californian kinds, than these do from one another;
and, therefore, they are all grouped as species of
the one genus, <i>Astacus</i>.</p>

<p>If, leaving California, we cross the Rocky Mountains
and enter the eastern States of the North American
Union, many sorts of crayfishes, which would at once be
recognised as such by any English visitor, will be found
to be abundant. But on careful examination it will be
discovered that all of these differ, both from the English
crayfish, and from <i>Astacus nigrescens</i>, to
a much greater <span class="xxpn" id="p248">{248}</span>
extent than those do from one another. The gills are,
in fact, reduced to seventeen on each side, in consequence
of the absence of the pleuro-branchia of the last thoracic
somite; and there are some other differences to which
it is not needful to refer at present. It
is convenient to <span class="xxpn" id="p249">{249}</span>
distinguish these seventeen-gilled crayfishes, as a whole,
from the eighteen-gilled species; and this is effected by
changing the generic name. They are no longer called
<i>Astacus</i>, but <i>Cambarus</i> (fig.
<a href="#f63" title="go to &#x66;ig. 63">63</a>).</p>

<p>All the individual crayfish referred to thus far, therefore,
have been sorted out, first into the groups termed
<i>species</i>; and then these species have been further sorted
into two divisions, termed <i>genera</i>. Each genus is an
abstraction, formed by summing up the common characters
of the species which it includes, just as each
species is an abstraction, composed of the common
characters of the individuals which belong to it; and
the one has no more existence in nature than the other.
The definition of the genus is simply a statement of
the plan of structure which is common to all the species
included under that genus; just as the definition of the
species is a statement of the common plan of structure
which runs throughout the individuals which compose
the species.</p>

<p>Again, crayfishes are found in the fresh waters of the
Southern hemisphere; and almost the whole of what
has been said respecting the structure of the English crayfish
applies to these; in other words, their general plan is
the same. But, in these southern crayfishes, the podobranchiæ
have no distinct lamina, and the first somite of
the abdomen is devoid of appendages in both sexes. The
southern crayfishes, like those of the Northern hemisphere,
are divisible into many species;
and these species <span class="xxpn" id="p250">{250}</span>
are susceptible of being grouped into six genera—<i>Astacoides</i>
(fig.
<a href="#f65" title="go to &#x66;ig. 65">65</a>), <i>Astacopsis</i>, <i>Chæraps</i>, <i>Parastacus</i> (fig.
<a href="#f64" title="go to &#x66;ig. 64">64</a>),
<i>Engæus</i>, and <i>Paranephrops</i>—on the same principle as
that which has led to the grouping of the Northern forms
into two genera. But the same
convenience which has <span class="xxpn" id="p252">{252}</span>
led to the association of groups of similar species into
genera, has given rise to the combination of allied genera
into higher groups, which are termed <i>Families</i>. It is
obvious that the definition of a family, as a statement of
the characters in which a certain number of genera agree,
is another morphological abstraction, which stands in the
same relation to generic, as generic do to specific abstractions.
Moreover, the definition of the family is a statement
of the plan of all the genera comprised in that family.</p>

<p>The family of the Northern crayfishes is termed
<i>Potamobiidæ</i>; that of the Southern crayfishes, <i>Parastacidæ</i>.
But these two families have in common all
those structural characters which are special to neither;
and, carrying out the metaphorical nomenclature of the
zoologist a stage further, we may say that the two form
a <i>Tribe</i>—the definition of which describes the plan which
is common to both families.</p>

morphological relations of the Astacina.</div></div>

<p>It may conduce to intelligibility if these results are put
into a graphic form. In fig.
<a href="#f66" title="go to &#x66;ig. 66">66</a>, A. is a diagram representing
the plan of an animal in which all the externally
visible parts which are found, more or less modified, in
the natural objects which we call individual crayfishes
are roughly sketched. It represents the plan of the
tribe. B. is a diagram exhibiting such a modification
of A. as converts it into the plan common to the whole
family of the <i>Parastacidæ</i>. C. stands in the same relation
to the <i>Potamobiidæ</i>. If the scheme were thoroughly
worked out, diagrams representing
the peculiarities of <span class="xxpn" id="p254">{254}</span>
form which characterize each of the genera and species,
would appear in the place of the names of the former, or
of the circles which represent the latter. All these
figures would represent abstractions—mental images
which have no existence outside the mind. Actual facts
would begin with drawings of individual animals, which
we may suppose to occupy the place of the dots above
the upper line in the diagram.</p>

<p>That all crayfishes may be regarded as modifications of
the common plan A, is not an hypothesis, but a generalization
obtained by comparing together the observations
made upon the structure of individual crayfishes. It is
simply a graphic method of representing the facts which
are commonly stated in the form of a definition of the
tribe of crayfishes, or <i>Astacina</i>.</p>

<p>This definition runs as follows:—</p>

<p>Multicellular animals provided with an alimentary
canal and with a chitinous cuticular exoskeleton; with
a ganglionated central nervous system traversed by the
œsophagus; possessing a heart and branchial respiratory
organs.</p>

<p>The body is bilaterally symmetrical, and consists of
twenty metameres (or somites and their appendages), of
which six are associated into a head, eight into a thorax,
and six into an abdomen. A telson is attached to the
last abdominal somite.</p>

<p>The somites of the abdominal region are all free, those
of the head and thorax, except the
hindermost, which is <span class="xxpn" id="p255">{255}</span>
partially free, are united into a cephalothorax, the tergal
wall of which has the form of a continuous carapace.
The carapace is produced in front into a rostrum, at the
sides into branchiostegites.</p>

<p>The eyes are placed at the ends of movable stalks.
The antennules are terminated by two filaments. The
exopodite of the antenna has the form of a mobile scale.
The mandible has a palp. The first and second maxillæ
are foliaceous; the second being provided with a large
scaphognathite. There are three pairs of maxillipedes,
and the endopodites of the third pair are narrow and
elongated. The next pair of thoracic appendages is much
larger than the rest, and is chelate, as are the two following
pairs, which are slender ambulatory limbs. The
hindmost two pairs of thoracic appendages are ambulatory
limbs, like the foregoing, but not chelate. The
abdominal appendages are small swimmerets, except the
sixth pair, which are very large, and have the exopodite
divided by a transverse joint.</p>

<p>All the crayfishes have a complex gastric armature.
The seven anterior thoracic limbs are provided with
podobranchiæ, but the first of these is always more or
less completely reduced to an epipodite. More or fewer
arthrobranchiæ always exist. Pleurobranchiæ may be
present or absent.</p>

<p>In this tribe of <i>Astacina</i> there are two families, the
<i>Potamobiidæ</i> and the <i>Parastacidæ</i>; and the definition of
each of these families is formed by
superadding to the <span class="xxpn" id="p256">{256}</span>
definition of the tribe the statement of the special peculiarities
of the family.</p>

<p>Thus, the <i>Potamobiidæ</i> are those <i>Astacina</i> in which
the podobranchiæ of the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth
thoracic appendages are always provided with a plaited
lamina, and that of the first is an epipodite devoid of
branchial filaments. The first abdominal somite invariably
bears appendages in the males, and usually in both
sexes. In the males these appendages are styliform, and
those of the second somite are always peculiarly modified.
The appendages of the four following somites are relatively
small. The telson is very generally divided by a
transverse incomplete hinge. None of the branchial filaments
are terminated by hooks; nor are any of the
coxopoditic setæ, or the longer setæ of the podobranchiæ
hooked, though hooked tubercles occur on the stem and
on the laminæ of the latter. The coxopoditic setæ are
always long and tortuous.</p>

<p>In the <i>Parastacidæ</i>, on the other hand, the podobranchiæ
are devoid of more than a rudiment of a
lamina, though the stem may be alate. The podobranchia
of the first maxillipede has the form of an
epipodite; but, in almost all cases, it bears a certain
number of well developed branchial filaments. The first
abdominal somite possesses no appendages in either sex:
and the appendages of the four following somites are
large. The telson is never divided by a transverse hinge.
More or fewer of the branchial
filaments of the <span class="xxpn" id="p257">{257}</span>
podobranchiæ are terminated by short hooked spines; and the
coxopoditic setæ, as well as those which beset the stems
of the podobranchiæ, have hooked apices.</p>

<p>The definitions of the genera would in like manner be
given by adding the distinctive characters of each genus
to the definitions of the family; and those of the species
by adding its character to those of the genus. But at
present it is unnecessary to pursue this topic further.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>There are no other inhabitants of the fresh waters, or
of the land, which could be mistaken for crayfishes; but
certain marine animals, familiar to every one, are so
strikingly similar to them, that one of these was formerly
included in the same genus, <i>Astacus</i>; while another is
very often known as the “Sea-crayfish.” These are the
“Common Lobster,” the “Norway Lobster,” and the
“Rock Lobster” or “Spiny Lobster.”</p>

<p>The common lobster (<i>Homarus vulgaris</i>, fig.
<a href="#f67" title="go to &#x66;ig. 67">67</a>)
presents the following distinctive characters. The last
thoracic somite is firmly adherent to the rest; the exopodite
of the antenna is so small as to appear like a mere
movable scale; all the abdominal appendages are well
developed in both sexes; and, in the males, the two anterior
pairs are somewhat like those of the male <i>Astacus</i>,
but less modified.</p>

(<sup class="supfct">1</sup>&#x2044;<sub class="subfct">3</sub> nat. size).</div></div>

<p>The principal difference from the <i>Astacina</i> is exhibited
by the gills, of which there are twenty on each side;
namely, six podobranchiæ, ten
arthrobranchiæ, and four <span class="xxpn" id="p259">{259}</span>
fully developed pleurobranchiæ. Moreover, the branchial
filaments of these gills are much stiffer and more
closely set than in most crayfishes. But the most important
distinction is presented by the podobranchiæ, in
which the stem is, as it were, completely split into two
parts longitudinally (as in fig.
<a href="#f68" title="go to &#x66;ig. 68">68</a>, B); one half (<i>ep</i>)
corresponding with the lamina of the crayfish gill, and the
other (<i>pl</i>) with its plume. Hence the base (<i>b</i>) of the
podobranchia bears the gill in front; while, behind, it
is continued into a broad epipoditic plate (<i>ep</i>) slightly
folded upon itself longitudinally but not plaited, as in the
crayfish.</p>

<p>The Norway Lobster (<i>Nephrops
norvegicus</i>, fig.
<a href="#f69" title="go to &#x66;ig. 69">69</a>) <span class="xxpn" id="p261">{261}</span>
resembles the lobster in those respects in which the latter
differs from the crayfishes: but the antennary squame is
large; and, in addition, the branchial plume of the podobranchia
of the second maxillipede is very small or absent,
so that the total number of functional branchiæ is reduced
to nineteen on each side.</p>

<p>These two genera, <i>Homarus</i> and <i>Nephrops</i>, therefore,
represent a family, <i>Homarina</i>, constructed upon the
same common plan as the crayfishes, but differing so
far from the <i>Astacina</i> in the structure of the branchiæ
and in some other points, that the distinction must be
expressed by putting them into a different tribe. It is
obvious that the special characteristics of the plan of the
<i>Homarina</i> give it much more likeness to that of the
<i>Potamobiidæ</i> than to that of the <i>Parastacidæ</i>.</p>

<p>The Rock Lobster (<i>Palinurus</i>, fig.
<a href="#f70" title="go to &#x66;ig. 70">70</a>) differs much more
from the crayfishes than either the common lobster or
the Norway lobster does. Thus, to refer only to the more
important distinctions, the antennæ are enormous; none
of the five posterior pairs of thoracic limbs are chelate,
and the first pair are not so large in proportion to the
rest as in the crayfishes and lobsters. The posterior
thoracic sterna are very broad, not comparatively narrow,
as in the foregoing genera. There are no appendages
to the first somite of the abdomen in either sex. In
this respect, it is curious to observe that, in contradistinction
from the <i>Homarina</i>, the Rock Lobsters are more
closely allied to the <i>Parastacidæ</i> than
to the <i>Potamobiidæ</i>. <span class="xxpn" id="p263">{263}</span>
The gills are similar to those of the lobsters, but reach
the number of twenty-one on each side.</p>

<div class="dctr03" id="f70">
<img src="images/i262.png"
 width="800" height="1051" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption">
<span class="smcap">F<b>IG.</b></span> 70. <i>Palinurus
vulgaris</i> (about <sup class="supfct">1</sup>&#x2044;<sub class="subfct">4</sub> nat. size).</div></div>

<p>In their fundamental structure the rock lobsters agree
with the crayfishes; hence the plans of the two may be
regarded as modifications of a plan common to both.
To this end, the only considerable changes needful in
the tribal plan of the crayfishes, are the substitution of
simple for chelate terminations to the middle thoracic
limbs and the suppression of the appendages of the first
somite of the abdomen.</p>

<p>Thus not only all the crayfishes, but all the lobsters
and rock lobsters, different as they are in appearance,
size, and habits of life, reveal to the morphologist unmistakable
signs of a fundamental unity of organization;
each is a comparatively simple variation of the general
theme—the common plan.</p>

<p>Even the branchiæ, which vary so much in number in
different members of these groups, are constructed upon
a uniform principle, and the differences which they
present are readily intelligible as the result of various
modifications of one and the same primitive arrangement.</p>

<p>In all, the gills are <i>trichobranchiæ</i>; that is, each gill
is somewhat like a bottle-brush, and presents a stem
beset, more or less closely, with many series of branchial
filaments. The largest number of complete branchiæ
possessed by any of the <i>Potamobiidæ</i>, <i>Parastacidæ</i>,
<i>Homaridæ</i>, or <i>Palinuridæ</i>, is twenty-one
on each side; <span class="xxpn" id="p264">{264}</span>
and when this number is present, the total is made up
of the same numbers of podobranchiæ, arthrobranchiæ,
and pleurobranchiæ attached to corresponding
somites. In <i>Palinurus</i> and in the genus <i>Astacopsis</i>
(which is one of the <i>Parastacidæ</i>), for example, there are
six podobranchiæ attached to the thoracic limbs from
the second to the seventh inclusively; five pairs of arthrobranchiæ
are attached to the interarticular membranes
of the thoracic limbs from the third to the seventh
inclusively, and one to that of the second, making eleven
in all; while four pleurobranchiæ are fixed to the
epimera of the four hindmost thoracic somites. Moreover,
in <i>Astacopsis</i>, the epipodite of the first thoracic
appendage (the first maxillipede) bears branchial filaments,
and is a sort of reduced gill.</p>

<p>These facts may be stated in a tabular form as
follows:—</p>

<p>As these formulæ show, those trichobranchiate crustacea,
which possess fewer than twenty-one complete
branchiæ on each side, commonly present traces of the
missing ones, either in the shape of epipodites, as in the
case of the podobranchiæ, or of minute rudiments, in the
case of the arthrobranchiæ and the pleurobranchiæ.</p>

<p>In the marine, prawn-like, genus Penæus (fig.
<a href="#f73" title="go to &#x66;ig. 73">73</a>,
Chap. VI.), the gills are curiously modified trichobranchiæ.
The number of functional branchiæ is, as in the
lobster, twenty; but the study of their disposition shows
that the total is made up in a very different way.</p>

<p>This case is very interesting; for it shows that
the whole of the podobranchiæ may lose their branchial
character, and be reduced to epipodites, as is the
case with the first in the crayfish and lobster, and
indeed in most of the forms under consideration.
And since all but one of the somites bear both
arthrobranchiæ and pleurobranchiæ, <span class="xxpn"
id="p268">{268}</span> the suggestion arises
that each hypothetically complete thoracic somite
should possess four gills on each side, giving the

<p>Starting from this hypothetically complete branchial
formula, we may regard all the actual formulæ as produced
from it by the more or less complete suppression
of the most anterior, or of the most posterior branchiæ,
or of both, in each series. In the case of the podobranchiæ,
the branchiæ are converted into epipodites; in
that of the other branchiæ, they become rudimentary, or
disappear.</p>

<p>In general appearance a common prawn (<i>Palæmon</i>,
fig.
<a href="#f71" title="go to &#x66;ig. 71">71</a>) is very similar to a miniature lobster or crayfish.
Nor does a closer examination fail to reveal a complete
fundamental likeness. The number of the somites, and
of the appendages, and their
general character and <span class="xxpn" id="p269">{269}</span>
disposition, are in fact the same. But, in the prawn, the abdomen
is much larger in proportion to the cephalothorax; the
basal scale, or expodite of the antenna, is much larger;
the external maxillipedes are longer, and differ less from the
succeeding thoracic appendages. The first pair of these,
which answers to the forceps of the crayfish, is chelate,
but it is very slender; the second pair, also chelate, is
always larger than the first, and
is sometimes exceedingly <span class="xxpn" id="p270">{270}</span>
long and strong (fig.
<a href="#f71" title="go to &#x66;ig. 71">71</a>, B); the remaining thoracic
limbs are terminated by simple claws. The five anterior
abdominal somites are all provided with large swimmerets,
which are used like paddles, when the animal swims
quietly; and, in the males, the first pair is only slightly
different from the rest. The rostrum is very large, and
strongly serrated.</p>

appendage of male.</div></div>

<p>None of these differences from the crayfish, however,
is so great, as to prepare us for the remarkable change
observable in the respiratory organs. The total number
of the gills is only eight. Of these, five are large pleurobranchiæ,
attached to the epimera of the five hinder
thoracic somites; two are arthrobranchiæ, fixed to the
interarticular membrane of the external maxillipede; and
one, which is the only complete podobranchia, belongs
to the second maxillipede. The podobranchiæ of the
first and third maxillipedes are represented only by small
epipodites. The branchial formula therefore is:—</p>

<p>The prawn, in fact, presents us with an extreme case
of that kind of modification of the branchial system, of
which <i>Penæus</i> has furnished a less complete example.
The series of the podobranchiæ is reduced almost to
nothing, while the large pleurobranchiæ are the chief
organs of respiration.</p>

<p>But this is not the only difference. The prawn’s
gills are not brush-like, but are foliaceous. They are
not <i>trichobranchiæ</i>, but <i>phyllobranchiæ</i>; that is to say,
the central stem of the branchia, instead of being beset
with numerous series of slender filaments, bears only two
rows of broad flat lamellæ (fig.
<a href="#f68" title="go to &#x66;ig. 68">68</a>, C, C′, <i>l</i>), which are
attached to opposite sides of the stem (C′, <i>s</i>), and gradually
diminish in size from the region of the stem by which
it is fixed, upwards and downwards. These lamellæ are
superimposed closely upon one another, like the leaves of
a book; and the blood traversing the numerous passages
by which their substance is excavated, comes into close
relation with the currents of aerated water, which are
driven between the branchial leaflets by a respiratory
mechanism of the same nature as that of the crayfish.</p>

<p>Different as these phyllobranchiæ of the prawns are in
appearance from the trichobranchiæ of the preceding
<i>Crustacea</i>, they are easily reduced to the same type. For in
the genus <i>Axius</i>, which is closely allied to the lobsters,
each branchial stem bears a single series of filaments on its
opposite sides; and if these biserial filaments are supposed
to widen out into broad leaflets,
the transition from <span class="xxpn" id="p272">{272}</span>
the trichobranchia to the phyllobranchia will be very
easily effected.</p>

<p>The shrimp (<i>Crangon</i>) also possesses phyllobranchiæ,
and differs from the prawn chiefly in the character of its
locomotive and prehensile thoracic limbs.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>There are yet other very well-known marine animals,
which, in common appreciation, are always associated with
the lobsters and crayfishes, although the difference of
general appearance is vastly greater than in any of the
cases which have yet been considered. These are the
Crabs.</p>

<p>In all the forms we have hitherto been considering,
the abdomen is as long as, or longer than, the cephalothorax,
while its width is the same, or but little less.
The sixth somite has very large appendages, which,
together with the telson, make up a powerful tail-fin;
and the large abdomen is thus fitted for playing an
important part in locomotion.</p>

<p>Again, the length of the cephalothorax is much greater
than its width, and it is produced in front into a long
rostrum. The bases of the antennæ are freely movable,
and they are provided with a movable exopodite. Moreover,
the eye-stalks are not inclosed in a cavity or orbit,
and the eyes themselves appear above and in front of
the antennules. The external maxillipedes are narrow,
and their endopodites are more or less leg-like.</p>

<p>None of these statements apply to the
crabs. In these <span class="xxpn" id="p273">{273}</span>
animals the abdomen is short, flattened, and apt to escape
immediate notice, as it is habitually kept closely applied
against the under surface of the
cephalothorax. It is <span class="xxpn" id="p274">{274}</span>
not used as a swimming organ; and the sixth somite
possesses no appendages whatever. The breadth of the
cephalothorax is often greater than its length, and there
is no prominent rostrum. In its place there is a truncated
process (fig.
<a href="#f72" title="go to &#x66;ig. 72">72</a>, B, <i>r</i>), which sends down a vertical
partition, and divides from one another two cavities, in
which the swollen basal joints of the small antennules (<i>2</i>)
are lodged. The outer boundary of each of these cavities
is formed by the basal part of the antenna (<i>3</i>), which is
firmly fixed to the edge of the carapace. There is no exopoditic
scale; and the free part of the antenna (<i>3′</i>) is very
small. The convex corneal surface of the eye appears
outside the base of the antenna, lodged in a sort of orbit
(<i>or</i>), the inner margin of which is formed by the base of
the antenna, while the upper and outer boundaries are
constituted by the carapace. Thus, while in all the preceding
forms, the eye is situated nearest the middle line,
and is most forward, while the antennule lies outside
and behind it, and the antenna comes next; in the crab,
the antennule occupies the innermost place, the antenna
comes next, and the eye appears to be external to and
behind the other two. But there is no real change in
the attachments of the eye-stalks. For if the antennule
and the basal joint of the antenna are removed, it will be
seen that the base of the eye-stalk is attached, as in the
crayfish, close to the middle line, on the inner side,
and in front of the antennule. But it is very long and
extends outwards, behind the antennule
and the antenna; <span class="xxpn" id="p275">{275}</span>
its corneal surface alone being visible, as it projects into
the orbit.</p>

<p>Again, the ischiopodites of the external maxillipedes
are expanded into broad quadrate plates, which meet in
the middle line, and close over the other manducatory
organs, like two folding-doors set in a square doorway.
Behind these there are great chelate forceps, as in the
crayfish; but the succeeding four pairs of ambulatory
limbs are terminated by simple claws.</p>

<p>When the abdomen is forcibly turned back, its sternal
surface is seen to be soft and membranous. There are no
swimmerets; but, in the female, the four anterior pairs
of abdominal limbs are represented by singular appendages,
which give attachment to the eggs; while in the
males there are two pairs of styliform organs attached
to the first and second somites of the abdomen, which
correspond with those of the male crayfishes.</p>

<p>The ventral portions of the branchiostegites are
sharply bent inwards, and their edges are so closely
applied throughout the greater part of their length to
the bases of the ambulatory limbs, that no branchial
cleft is left. In front of the bases of the forceps, however,
there is an elongated aperture, which can be shut
or opened by a sort of valve, connected with the external
maxillipede, which serves for the entrance of water into
the branchial cavity. The water employed in respiration,
and kept in constant motion by the action of the scaphognathite,
is baled out through
two apertures, which <span class="xxpn" id="p276">{276}</span>
are separated from the foregoing by the external maxillipedes,
and lie at the sides of the quadrate space in
which these organs are set.</p>

<p>There are only nine gills on each side, and these,
as in the prawn and shrimp, are phyllobranchiæ.
Seven of the branchiæ are pyramidal in shape, and for
the most part of large size. When the branchiostegite
is removed, they are seen lying close against its inner
walls, their apices converging towards its summit. The
two hindermost of these gills are pleurobranchiæ, the
other five are arthrobranchiæ. The two remaining gills
are podobranchiæ, and belong to the second and the
third maxillipedes respectively. Each is divided into a
branchial and an epipoditic portion, the latter having the
form of a long curved blade. The branchial portion of
the podobranchia of the second maxillipede is long, and
lies horizontally under the bases of the four anterior
arthrobranchiæ; while the gill of the podobranchia of
the third maxillipede is short and triangular, and fits in
between the bases of the second and the third arthrobranchiæ.
The epipodite of the third maxillipede is very
long, and its base furnishes the valve of the afferent
aperture of the branchial cavity, which has been mentioned
above. The podobranchia of the first maxillipede
is represented only by a long curved epipoditic blade,
which can sweep over the outer surface of the gills, and
doubtless serves to keep them clear
of foreign bodies. <span class="xxpn" id="p277">{277}</span></p>

<p>It will be observed that the suppression of branchiæ
has here taken place in all the series, and at both the
anterior and the posterior ends of each. But the defect
in total number is made up by the increase of size, not of
the pleurobranchiæ alone, as in the case of the prawns,
but of the arthrobranchiæ as well. At the same time
the whole apparatus has become more specialized and
perfected as a breathing organ. The close fitting of the
edges of the carapace, and the possibility of closing the
inhalent and exhalent apertures, render the crabs much
more independent of actual immersion in water than most
of their congeners; and some of them habitually live on
dry land and breathe by means of the atmospheric air
which they take into and expel from their branchial cavities.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these wide departures from the
structure and habits of the crayfishes, however, attentive
examination shows that the plan of
construction of the <span class="xxpn" id="p278">{278}</span>
crab is, in all fundamental respects, the same as that of the
crayfish. The body is made up of the same number of
somites. The appendages of the head and of the thorax
are identical in number, in function, and even in the
general pattern of their structure. But two pairs of
abdominal appendages in the female, and four pairs in
the male, have disappeared. The exopodites of the
antennæ have vanished, and not even epipodites remain
to represent the podobranchiæ of the posterior five
pairs of thoracic limbs. The exceedingly elongated eye-stalks
are turned backwards and outwards, above the
bases of the antennules and the antennæ, and the bases
of the latter have become united with the edges of the
carapace in front of them. In this manner the extraordinary
face, or <i>metope</i> (fig.
<a href="#f72" title="go to &#x66;ig. 72">72</a>, B) of the crab results
from a simple modification of the arrangement of parts,
every one of which exists in the crayfish. The same
common plan serves for both.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The foregoing illustrations are taken from a few of our
commonest and most easily obtainable <i>Crustacea</i>; but they
amply suffice to exemplify the manner in which the conception
of a plan of organization, common to a multitude
of animals of extremely diverse outward forms and habits,
is forced upon us by mere comparative anatomy.</p>

<p>Nothing would be easier, were the occasion fitting, than
to extend this method of comparison to the whole of the
several thousand species of
crab-like, crayfish-like, or <span class="xxpn" id="p279">{279}</span>
prawn-like animals, which, from the fact that they all
have their eyes set upon movable stalks, are termed the
<i>Podophthalmia</i>, or stalk-eyed <i>Crustacea</i>; and by arguments
of similar force to prove that they are all modifications
of the same common plan. Not only so, but the
sand-hoppers of the sea-shore, the wood-lice of the land,
and the water-fleas or the monoculi of the ponds, nay,
even such remote forms as the barnacles which adhere to
floating wood, and the acorn shells which crowd every inch
of rock on many of our coasts, reveal the same fundamental
organization. Further than this, the spiders
and the scorpions, the millipedes and the centipedes, and
the multitudinous legions of the insect world, show us,
amid infinite diversity of detail, nothing which is new in
principle to any one who has mastered the morphology
of the crayfish.</p>

<p>Given a body divided into somites, each with a pair
of appendages; and given the power to modify those
somites and their appendages in strict accordance with
the principles by which the common plan of the <i>Podophthalmia</i>
is modified in the actually existing members of
that order; and the whole of the <i>Arthropoda</i>, which
probably make up two-thirds of the animal world, might
readily be educed from one primitive form.</p>

<p>And this conclusion is not merely speculative. As a
matter of observation, though the <i>Arthropoda</i> are not all
evolved from one primitive form, in one sense of the
words, yet they are in another. For each
can be traced <span class="xxpn" id="p280">{280}</span>
back in the course of its development to an ovum, and
that ovum gives rise to a blastoderm, from which the
parts of the embryo arise in a manner essentially similar
to that in which the young crayfish is developed.</p>

<p>Moreover, in a large proportion of the <i>Crustacea</i>, the
embryo leaves the egg under the form of a small oval
body, termed a <i>Nauplius</i> (fig.
<a href="#f73" title="go to &#x66;ig. 73">73</a>, D), provided with
(usually) three pairs of appendages, which play the part
of swimming limbs, and with a median eye. Changes of
form accompanied by sheddings of the cuticle take place,
in virtue of which the larva passes into a new stage, when
it is termed a <i>Zoæa</i> (C). In this, the three pairs of locomotive
appendages of the <i>Nauplius</i> are metamorphosed
into rudimentary antennules, antennæ, and mandibles,
while two or more pairs of anterior thoracic appendages
provided with exopodites and hence appearing bifurcated,
subserve locomotion. The abdomen has grown out and
become a notable feature of the Zoæa, but it has no
appendages.</p>

<p>In some <i>Podophthalmia</i>, as in <i>Penæus</i> (fig, 73), the
young leaves the egg as a Nauplius, and the Nauplius
becomes a Zoæa. The hinder thoracic appendages, each
provided with an epipodite, appear; the stalked eyes and
the abdominal members are developed, and the larva passes
into what is sometimes called the <i>Mysis</i> or <i>Schizopod</i>
stage. The adult state differs from this chiefly in the
presence of branchiæ and the rudimentary character of
the exopodites of the five
posterior thoracic limbs. <span class="xxpn" id="p281">{281}</span></p>

of <i>Penæus</i>. D, Nauplius. (B, C, and D, after Fritz
Müller.)</div></div>

<p>In the Opossum-shrimps (<i>Mysis</i>) the young does
not leave the pouch of the mother until
it is fully <span class="xxpn" id="p282">{282}</span>
developed; and, in this case, the <i>Nauplius</i> state is
passed through so rapidly and in so early and imperfect a
condition of the embryo, that it would not be recognized
except for the cuticle which is developed and is subsequently
shed.</p>

Spence Bate). (The figures A and B are more magnified
than C and D.)</div></div>

<div class="dxxpn"><span class="xxpn" id="p283">{283}</span></div>

<p>In the great majority of the <i>Podophthalmia</i>, the Nauplius
stage seems to be passed over without any such clear
evidence of its occurrence, and the young is set free as a
Zoæa. In the lobsters, which have, throughout life, a
large abdomen provided with swimmerets, the Zoæa,
after going through a Mysis or Schizopod stage, passes
into the adult form.</p>

<p>In the crab, the young leaves the egg as a Zoæa
(fig.
<a href="#f74" title="go to &#x66;ig. 74">74</a>, A and B). But this is not followed by a
Schizopod stage, inasmuch as the five hinder pair of
thoracic limbs are apparently, from the first, devoid of
exopodites. But the Zoæa, after it has acquired stalked
eyes and a complete set of thoracic and abdominal
members, and has passed into what is called the <i>Megalopa</i>
stage (fig.
<a href="#f74" title="go to &#x66;ig. 74">74</a>, C and D), suffers a more complete
metamorphosis. The carapace widens, the fore part of
the head is modified so as to bring about the formation
of the characteristic metope: and the abdomen, losing
more or fewer of its posterior appendages, takes up its
final position under the thorax.</p>

<p>In the Zoæa state, those thoracic limbs which give rise
to the maxillipedes are provided with well-developed
exopodites, and in the free Mysis state all these limbs
have exopodites. In the Opossum-shrimps these persist
throughout life; in <i>Penæus</i>, the rudiments of them only
remain; in the lobster, they disappear altogether.</p>

<p>Thus, in these animals, there is no difficulty in demonstrating
that embryological uniformity of type
of all the <span class="xxpn" id="p284">{284}</span>
limbs, complete evidence of which was not furnished by the
development of the crayfish. In this crustacean, in fact,
it would appear that the process of development has
undergone its maximum of abbreviation. The embryo
presents no distinct and independent Nauplius or Zoæa
stages, and, as in the crab, there is no Schizopod or
Mysis stage. The abdominal appendages are developed
very early, and the new born young, which resembles the
Megalopa stage of the crab, differs only in a few points
from the adult animal.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Guided by comparative morphology, we are thus led
to admit that the whole of the <i>Arthropoda</i> are connected
by closer or more remote degrees of affinity with the
crayfish. If we were to study the perch and the pond-snail
with similar care, we should be led to analogous
conclusions. For the perch is related by similar gradations,
in the first place, with other fishes; then more
remotely, with frogs and newts, reptiles, birds, and
mammals; or, in other words, with the whole of the
great division of the <i>Vertebrata</i>. The pond-snail, by
like reasoning upon analogous data, is connected with
the <i>Mollusca</i>, in all their innumerable kinds of slugs,
shellfish, squids, and cuttlefish. And, in each case, the
study of development takes us back to an egg as the
primary condition of the animal, and to the process of
yelk division, the formation of a blastoderm, and the conversion
of that blastoderm into a more
or less modified <span class="xxpn" id="p285">{285}</span>
gastrula, as the early stages of development. The like
is true of all the worms, sea-urchins, starfishes, jellyfishes,
polypes, and sponges; and it is only in the minutest and
simplest forms of animal life that the germ, or representative
of the ovum becomes metamorphosed into the
adult form without the preliminary process of division.</p>

<p>In the majority even of these <i>Protozoa</i>, the typical
structure of the nucleated cell is retained, and the whole
animal is the equivalent of a histological unit of one of
the higher organisms. An <i>Amœba</i> is strictly comparable,
morphologically, to one of the corpuscles of the blood of
the crayfish.</p>

<p>Thus, to exactly the same extent as it is legitimate
to represent all the crayfishes as modifications of the
common astacine plan, it is legitimate to represent all
the multicellular animals as modifications of the gastrula,
and the gastrula itself as a peculiarly disposed aggregate
of cells; while the <i>Protozoa</i> are such cells either isolated,
or otherwise aggregated.</p>

<p>It is easy to demonstrate that all plants are either
cell aggregates, or simple cells; and as it is impossible
to draw any precise line of demarcation, either physiological
or morphological, between the simplest plants,
and the simplest of the <i>Protozoa</i>, it follows that all forms
of life are morphologically related to one another; and
that in whatever sense we say that the English and the
Californian crayfish are allied, in the same sense, though
not to the same degree, must we admit that
all living things <span class="xxpn" id="p286">{286}</span>
are allied. Given one of those protoplasmic bodies, of
which we are unable to say certainly whether it is animal
or plant, and endow it with such inherent capacities of
self-modification as are manifested daily under our eyes
by developing ova, and we have a sufficient reason for
the existence of any plant, or of any animal.</p>

<p>This is the great result of comparative morphology;
and it is carefully to be noted that this result is not a
speculation, but a generalisation. The truths of anatomy
and of embryology are generalised statements of facts
of experience; the question whether an animal is more
or less like another in its structure and in its development,
or not, is capable of being tested by observation;
the doctrine of the unity of organisation of plants and
animals is simply a mode of stating the conclusions
drawn from experience. But, if it is a just mode of
stating these conclusions, then it is undoubtedly conceivable
that all plants and all animals may have been
evolved from a common physical basis of life, by processes
similar to those which we every day see at work
in the evolution of individual animals and plants from
that foundation.</p>

<p>That which is conceivable, however, is by no means
necessarily true; and no amount of purely morphological
evidence can suffice to prove that the forms
of life have come into existence in one way rather
than another.</p>

<p>There is a common plan among churches,
no less than <span class="xxpn" id="p287">{287}</span>
among crayfishes; nevertheless the churches have certainly
not been developed from a common ancestor, but
have been built separately. Whether the different kinds
of crayfishes have been built separately, is a problem we
shall not be in a position to grapple with, until we have
considered a series of facts connected with them, which
have not yet been touched upon.</p>

THE DISTRIBUTION AND THE ÆTIOLOGY OF THE
CRAYFISHES.</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">So far as I have been able to
discover, all the crayfishes which inhabit the
British islands agree in every point with the full
description given above, at p.
<a href="#p230" title="go to &#x70;. 230">230</a>. They are abundant
in some of our rivers, such as the Isis, and other
affluents of the Thames; and they have been observed
in those of Devon;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn15"
id="fnanc15">15</a> but they appear to be absent from
many others. I cannot hear of any, for example, in
the Cam or the Ouse, on the east, or in the rivers of
Lancashire and Cheshire, on the west. It is still more
remarkable that, according to the best information
I can obtain, they are absent in the Severn, though
they are plentiful in the Thames and Severn canal. Dr.
M<sup class="supsm">c</sup>Intosh, who has paid particular attention
to the fauna of Scotland, assures me that crayfish are
unknown north of the Tweed. In Ireland, on the other
hand, they occur in many localities;<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn16" id="fnanc16">16</a> but the question
whether their diffusion, and even their introduction
into this <span class="xxpn" id="p289">{289}</span>
island, has or has not been effected by artificial
means, is involved in some obscurity.</p>

<p>English zoologists have always termed our crayfish
<i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>; and, up to a recent period, the
majority of Continental naturalists have included a
corresponding form of <i>Astacus</i> under that specific
name.</p>

<p>Thus M. Milne Edwards, in his classical work on the
<i>Crustacea</i>,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn17" id="fnanc17">17</a>
published in 1837, observes under the head of
“Écrevisse commune. <i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>:” “There are
two varieties of this crayfish; in the one, the rostrum
gradually becomes narrower from its base onwards, and
the lateral spines are situated close to its extremity;
in the other, the lateral edges of the rostrum are parallel
in their posterior half and the lateral spines are stronger
and more remote from the end.”</p>

<p>The “first variety,” here mentioned, is known under
the name of “Écrevisse à pieds blancs”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn18" id="fnanc18">18</a>
in France,
by way of distinction from the “second variety,” which
is termed “Écrevisse à pieds rouges,” on account of
the more or less extensive red coloration of the forceps
and ambulatory limbs. This second variety is the larger,
commonly attaining five inches in length, and sometimes
reaching much larger dimensions; and it is more highly
esteemed for the market, on account of its better flavour.</p>

<p>In Germany, the two forms have long been popularly
distinguished, the former by the
name of “Steinkrebs,” <span class="xxpn" id="p290">{290}</span>
or “stone crayfish,” and the latter by that of “Edelkrebs,”
or “noble crayfish.”</p>

<p>Milne Edwards, it will be observed, speaks of these
two forms of crayfish as “varieties” of the species
<i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>; but, even as far back as the year
1803 some zoologists began to regard the “stone crayfish”
as a distinct species, to which Schrank applied the
name of <i>Astacus torrentium</i>, while the “noble crayfish”
remained in possession of the old denomination, <i>Astacus
fluviatilis</i>; and, subsequently, various forms of “stone-crayfishes”
have been further distinguished as the species
<i>Astacus saxatilis</i>, <i>A. tristis</i>, <i>A. pallipes</i>, <i>A. fontinalis</i>,
&amp;c. On the other hand, Dr. Gerstfeldt,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn19" id="fnanc19">19</a>
who has devoted
especial attention to the question, denies that these
are anything more than varieties of one species; but he
holds this and Milne Edwards’s “second variety” to be
specifically distinct from one another.</p>

“Ueber die Flusskrebse Europas.” Mém. de l’Acad. de St. Petersburg,
1859.</p></div>

<p>We thus find ourselves in the presence of three views
respecting the English and French crayfishes.</p>

<p>1. They are all varieties of one species—<i>A. fluviatilis</i>.</p>

<p>2. There are two species—<i>A. fluviatilis</i>, and <i>A. torrentium</i>,
of which last there are several varieties.</p>

<p>3. There are, at fewest, five or six distinct species.</p>

<p>Before adopting the one or the other of these
views, it is necessary to form a definite conception of
the meaning of the terms
“species” and “variety.” <span class="xxpn" id="p291">{291}</span></p>

<p>The word “species” in Biology has two significations;
the one based upon morphological, the other upon
physiological considerations.</p>

<p>A species, in the strictly morphological sense, is simply
an assemblage of individuals which agree with one another,
and differ from the rest of the living world in the sum
of their morphological characters; that is to say, in
the structure and in the development of both sexes.
If the sum of these characters in one group is represented
by A, and that in another by A&#x2009;+&#x202f;<i>n</i>; the two
are morphological species, whether <i>n</i> represents an
important or an unimportant difference.</p>

<p>The great majority of species described in works on
Systematic Zoology are merely morphological species.
That is to say, one or more specimens of a kind of animal
having been obtained, these specimens have been found
to differ from any previously known by the character or
characters <i>n</i>; and this difference constitutes the definition
of the new species, and is all we really know
about its distinctness.</p>

<p>But, in practice, the formation of specific groups is
more or less qualified by considerations based upon what
is known respecting variation. It is a matter of observation
that progeny are never exactly like their parents,
but present small and inconstant differences from them.
Hence, when specific identity is predicated of a group of
individuals, the meaning conveyed is not that they are
all exactly alike, but only that their
differences are so <span class="xxpn" id="p292">{292}</span>
small, and so inconstant, that they lie within the
probable limits of individual variation.</p>

<p>Observation further acquaints us with the fact, that,
sometimes, an individual member of a species may
exhibit a more or less marked variation, which is propagated
through all the offspring of that individual,
and may even become intensified in them. And, in
this manner, a <i>variety</i>, or <i>race</i>, is generated within the
species; which variety, or race, if nothing were known
respecting its origin, might have every claim to be
regarded as a separate morphological species. The
distinctive characters, of a race, however, are rarely
equally well marked in all the members of the race.
Thus suppose the species A to develop the race A&#x2009;+&#x202f;<i>x</i>;
then the difference <i>x</i> is apt to be much less in some
individuals than in others; so that, in a large suite of
specimens, the interval between A&#x2009;+&#x202f;<i>x</i> and A will be
filled up by a series of forms in which <i>x</i> gradually
diminishes.</p>

<p>Finally, it is a matter of observation that modification
of the physical conditions under which a species lives
favours the development of varieties and races.</p>

<p>Hence, in the case of two specimens having respectively
the characters A and A&#x2009;+&#x202f;<i>n</i>, although, <i>primâ facie</i>,
they are of distinct species; yet if a large collection
shows us that the interval between A and A&#x2009;+&#x202f;<i>n</i> is filled
up by forms of A having traces of <i>n</i>, and forms of A&#x2009;+&#x202f;<i>n</i>
in which <i>n</i> becomes less and less, then
it will be <span class="xxpn" id="p293">{293}</span>
concluded that A and A&#x2009;+&#x202f;<i>n</i> are races of one species and
not separate species. And this conclusion will be fortified
if A and A&#x2009;+&#x202f;<i>n</i> occupy different stations in the same
geographical area.</p>

<p>Even when no transitional forms between A and A&#x2009;+&#x202f;<i>n</i>
are discoverable, if <i>n</i> is a small and unimportant difference,
such as of average size, colour, or ornamentation,
it may be fairly held that A and A&#x2009;+&#x202f;<i>n</i> are mere
varieties; inasmuch as experience proves that such
variations may take place comparatively suddenly; or
the intermediate forms may have died out and thus the
evidence of variation may have been effaced.</p>

<p>From what has been said it follows that the groups
termed morphological species are provisional arrangements,
expressive simply of the present state of our
knowledge.</p>

<p>We call two groups species, if we know of no transitional
forms between them, and if there is no reason to
believe that the differences which they present are such
as may arise in the ordinary course of variation. But
it is impossible to say whether the progress of inquiry
into the characters of any group of individuals
may prove that what have hitherto been taken for mere
varieties are distinct morphological species; or whether,
on the contrary, it may prove that what have hitherto
been regarded as distinct morphological species are mere
varieties.</p>

<p>What has happened in the case of the
crayfish is this: <span class="xxpn" id="p294">{294}</span>
the older observers lumped all the Western European
forms which came under their notice under one species,
<i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>; noting, more or less distinctly, the
stone crayfish and the noble crayfish as races or varieties
of that species. Later zoologists, comparing crayfishes
together more critically, and finding that the stone
crayfish is ordinarily markedly different from the noble
crayfish, concluded that there were no transitional forms,
and made the former into a distinct species, tacitly assuming
that the differential characters are not such as
could be produced by variation.</p>

<p>It is at present an open question whether further
investigation will or will not bear out either of these
assumptions. If large series of specimens of both stone
crayfishes and noble crayfishes from different localities
are carefully examined, they will be found to present
great variations in size and colour, in the tuberculation
of the carapace and limbs, and in the absolute and
relative sizes of the forceps.</p>

<p>The most constant characters of the stone crayfish
are:—</p>

<p>1. The tapering form of the rostrum and the approximation
of the lateral spines to its point; the distance
between these spines being about equal to their distance
from the apex of the rostrum (fig.
<a href="#f61" title="go to &#x66;ig. 61">61</a>, A).</p>

<p>2. The development of one or two spines from the
ventral margin of the rostrum.</p>

<p>3. The gradual subsidence of the
posterior part of <span class="xxpn" id="p295">{295}</span>
the post-orbital ridge, and the absence of spines on its
surface.</p>

<p>4. The large relative size of the posterior division of
the telson (G).</p>

<p>On the contrary, in the noble crayfish:—</p>

<p>1. The sides of the posterior two-thirds of the
rostrum are nearly parallel, and the lateral spines are
fully a third of the length of the rostrum from its point;
the distance between them being much less than their
distance from the apex of the rostrum (B).</p>

<p>2. No spine is developed from the ventral margin of
the rostrum.</p>

<p>3. The posterior part of the post-orbital ridge is a
more or less distinct, sometimes spinous elevation.</p>

<p>4. The posterior division of the telson is smaller
relatively to the anterior division (H).</p>

<p>I may add that I have found three rudimentary pleurobranchiæ
in the noble crayfish, and never more than two
in the stone crayfish.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain whether no crayfish exist in
which the characters of the parts here referred to are
intermediate between those defined, it would be necessary
to examine numerous examples of each kind of crayfish
from all parts of the areas which they respectively
inhabit. This has been done to some extent, but by no
means thoroughly; and I think that all that can be safely
said, at present, is that the existence of intermediate
forms is not proven. But, whatever the
constancy of the <span class="xxpn" id="p296">{296}</span>
differences between the two kinds of crayfishes, there can
surely be no doubt as to their insignificance; and no
question that they are no more than such as, judging by
analogy, might be produced by variation.</p>

<p>From a morphological point of view, then, it is really
impossible to decide the question whether the stone crayfish
and the noble crayfish should be regarded as species
or as varieties. But, since it will, hereafter, be convenient
to have distinct names for the two kinds, I shall speak
of them as <i>Astacus torrentium</i> and <i>Astacus nobilis</i>.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn20" id="fnanc20">20</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc20" id="fn20">20</a>
According to strict zoological usage the names
should be written <i>A. fluviatilis</i> (var. <i>torrentium</i>) and
<i>A. fluviatilis</i> (var. <i>nobilis</i>) on the hypothesis that
the stone crayfish and the noble crayfish are varieties;
and <i>A. torrentium</i> and <i>A. fluviatilis</i> on the hypothesis
that they are species; but as I neither wish to prejudge
the species question, nor to employ cumbrously long names,
I take a third course.</p></div>

<p>In the physiological sense, a species means, firstly, a
group of animals the members of which are capable of
completely fertile union with one another, but not with
the members of any other group; and, secondly, it
means all the descendants of a primitive ancestor or
ancestors, supposed to have originated otherwise than by
ordinary generation.</p>

<p>It is clear that, even if crayfishes had an unbegotten
ancestor, there is no means of knowing whether the
stone crayfish and the noble crayfish are descendants of
the same, or of different ancestors, so that the second
sense of species hardly concerns us. As to the first
sense, there is no evidence to show
whether the two <span class="xxpn" id="p297">{297}</span>
kinds of crayfish under consideration are capable of fertile
union or whether they are sterile. It is said, however,
that hybrids or mongrels are not met with in the waters
which are inhabited by both kinds, and that the breeding
season of the stone crayfish begins earlier than that of
the noble crayfish.</p>

<p>M. Carbonnier, who practises crayfish culture on a large
scale, gives some interesting facts bearing on this question
in the work already cited. He says that, in the
streams of France, there are two very distinct kinds of
crayfishes—the red-clawed crayfish (L’Écrevisse à pieds
rouges), and the white-clawed crayfish (L’Écrevisse à
pieds blancs), and that the latter inhabit the swifter
streams. In a piece of land converted into a crayfish
farm, in which the white-clawed crayfish existed naturally
in great abundance, 300,000 red-clawed crayfish
were introduced in the course of five years; nevertheless,
at the end of this time, no intermediate forms were
to be seen, and the “pieds rouges” exhibited a marked
superiority in size over the “pieds blancs.” M. Carbonnier,
in fact, says that they were nearly twice as big.</p>

<p>On the whole, the facts as at present known, seem to
incline rather in favour of the conclusion that <i>A. torrentium</i>
and <i>A. nobilis</i> are distinct species; in the sense
that transitional forms have not been clearly made out,
and that, possibly, they do not interbreed.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>As I have already remarked,
the very numerous <span class="xxpn" id="p298">{298}</span>
specimens of English and Irish crayfishes which have
passed through my hands, have all presented the character
of <i>Astacus torrentium</i>, with which also the description
given in works of recognised authority coincides as far as
it goes.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn21" id="fnanc21">21</a>
The same form is found in many parts of
France, as far south as the Pyrenees, and it is met with
as far east as Alsace and Switzerland. I have recently<a class="afnanc" href="#fn22" id="fnanc22">22</a>
been enabled, by the kindness of Dr. Bolivar, of Madrid,
who sent me a number of crayfishes from the neighbourhood
of that city, to satisfy myself that the Spanish
peninsula contains crayfishes altogether similar to those
of Britain, except that the subrostral spine is less developed.
Further, I have no doubt that Dr. Heller<a class="afnanc" href="#fn23" id="fnanc23">23</a>
is
right in his identification of the English crayfish with
a form which he describes under the name of <i>A.
saxatilis</i>. He says that it is especially abundant in
Southern Europe, and that it occurs in Greece, in
Dalmatia, in the islands of Cherso and Veglia, at Trieste,
in the Lago di Garda, and at Genoa. Further, <i>Astacus
torrentium</i> appears to be widely distributed in North
Germany. The eastern limit of this crayfish is uncertain;
but, according to Kessler,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn24" id="fnanc24">24</a>
it does not occur within the
limits of
the Russian empire. <span class="xxpn" id="p299">{299}</span></p>

<p><i>Astacus torrentium</i> appears to be particularly addicted
to rapid highland streams and the turbid pools which
they feed.</p>

<p><i>Astacus nobilis</i> is indigenous to France, Germany, and
the Italian peninsula. It is said to be found at Nice
and at Barcelona, though I cannot hear of it elsewhere
in Spain. Its south-eastern limit appears to be the Lake
of Zirknitz, in Carniola, not far from the famous caves of
Adelsberg. It is not known in Dalmatia, in Turkey, nor
in Greece. In the Russian empire, according to Kessler,
this crayfish chiefly inhabits the watershed of the Baltic.
The northern limit of its distribution lies between Christianstad,
in the Gulf of Bothnia (62°&#x2009;16′&#x2009;N), and Serdobol,
at the northern end of Lake Ladoga. “Eastward of
Lake Ladoga it is found in the Uslanka, a tributary of
the Swir. It appears to be the only crayfish which exists
in the waters which flow from the south into the Gulf of
Finland and into the Baltic; except in those streams and
lakes which have been artificially connected with the Volga,
and in which it is partially replaced by <i>A. leptodactylus</i>.”
It still inhabits the Lakes of Beresai and Bologoe, as
well as the affluents of the Msta and the Wolchow; and
it is met with in affluents of the Dnieper, as far as
Mohilew. <i>Astacus nobilis</i> is also found in Denmark and
Southern Sweden; but, in the latter country, its introduction
appears to have been artificial. This crayfish
is said occasionally to be met with on the Livonian coast
in the waters of the Baltic, which,
however, it must <span class="xxpn" id="p300">{300}</span>
be remembered, are much less salt than ordinary sea
water.</p>

<p>It will be observed that while the two forms, <i>A. torrentium</i>
and <i>A. nobilis</i>, are intermixed over a large part of
Central Europe, <i>A. torrentium</i> has a wider north-westward,
south-westward, and south-eastward extension,
being the sole occupant of Britain, and apparently of
the greater part of Spain and of Greece. On the other
hand, in the northern and eastern parts of Central
Europe, <i>A. nobilis</i> appears to exist alone.</p>

<p>Further to the east, a new form, <i>Astacus leptodactylus</i>
(fig.
<a href="#f75" title="go to &#x66;ig. 75">75</a>), makes its appearance. Whether <i>A. leptodactylus</i>
exists in the upper waters of the Danube, does not appear,
but in the lower Danube and in the Theiss it is the
dominant, if not the exclusive, crayfish. From hence it
extends through all the rivers which flow into the Black,
Azov, and Caspian
Seas, from Bessarabia
and Podolia on the west, to the Ural mountains on the east.
In fact, the natural habitat of this crayfish appears to be
the watershed of the Pontocaspian area, excluding that
part of the Black Sea which lies southward of the Caucasus
on the one hand, and of the mouths of the Danube on the
other.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn25" id="fnanc25">25</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc25" id="fn25">25</a>
These statements rest on the authority of Kessler and Gerstfeldt,
in their memoirs already cited.</p></div>

<p>It is a remarkable circumstance that this crayfish not
only thrives in the brackish waters of the estuaries of
the rivers which debouche into the Black Sea and the
Sea of Azov, but that it is found even
in the salter <span class="xxpn" id="p302">{302}</span>
southern parts of the Caspian, in which it lives at
considerable depths.</p>

<p>In the north, <i>Astacus leptodactylus</i> is met
with in the rivers which flow into the White Sea,
as well as in many streams and lakes about the Gulf
of Finland. But it has probably been introduced
into these streams by the canals which have been
constructed to connect the basin of the Volga with the
rivers which flow into the Baltic and into the White
Sea. In the latter, the invading <i>A. leptodactylus</i>
is everywhere overcoming and driving out <i>A. nobilis</i>
in the struggle for existence, apparently in virtue
of its more rapid multiplication.<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn26" id="fnanc26">26</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc26" id="fn26">26</a>
Kessler (Die Russischen Flusskrebse, l. c. p.
369–70), has an interesting discussion of this question.</p></div>

<p>In the Caspian and in the brackish waters of the
estuaries of the Dniester and the Bug, a somewhat
different crayfish, which has been called <i>Astacus pachypus</i>,
occurs; another closely allied form (<i>A. angulosus</i>) is met
with in the mountain streams of the Crimea and of the
northern face of the Caucasus; and a third, <i>A. colchicus</i>,
has recently been discovered in the Rion, or Phasis of
the ancients, which flows into the eastern extremity of
the Black Sea.</p>

<p>With respect to the question whether these Pontocaspian
crayfishes are specifically distinct from one
another, and whether the most widely distributed kind,
<i>A. leptodactylus</i>, is distinct from <i>A. nobilis</i>, exactly the
same difficulties arise as in the case of
the west European <span class="xxpn" id="p303">{303}</span>
crayfishes. Gerstfeldt, who has had the opportunity of
examining large series of specimens, concludes that the
Pontocaspian crayfishes and <i>A. nobilis</i> are all varieties
of one species. Kessler, on the contrary, while he
admits that <i>A. angulosus</i> is, and <i>A. pachypus</i> may be,
a variety of <i>A. leptodactylus</i>, affirms that the latter is
specifically distinct from <i>A. nobilis</i>.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, well marked examples of <i>A. leptodactylus</i>
are very different from <i>A. nobilis</i>.</p>

<p>1. The edges of the rostrum are produced into five or
six sharp spines, instead of being smooth or slightly
serrated as in <i>A. nobilis</i>.</p>

<p>2. The fore part of the rostrum has no serrated
spinous median keel, such as commonly, though not universally,
exists in <i>A. nobilis</i>.</p>

<p>3. The posterior end of the post-orbital ridge is still
more distinct and spiniform than in <i>A. nobilis</i>.</p>

<p>4. The abdominal pleura of <i>A. leptodactylus</i> are narrower,
more equal sided, and triangular in shape.</p>

<p>5. The chelæ of the forceps, especially in the males,
are more elongated; and the moveable and fixed claws
are slenderer and have their opposed edges straighter
and less tuberculated.</p>

<p>But, in all these respects, individual specimens of
<i>A. nobilis</i> vary in the direction of <i>A. leptodactylus</i> and
<i>vice versâ</i>; and if <i>A. angulosus</i> and <i>A. pachypus</i> are
varieties of <i>A. leptodactylus</i>, I cannot see why Gerstfeldt’s
conclusion that <i>A. nobilis</i> is
another variety of <span class="xxpn" id="p304">{304}</span>
the same form need be questioned on morphological
grounds. However, Kessler asserts that, in those localities
in which <i>A. leptodactylus</i> and <i>A. nobilis</i> live
together, no intermediate forms occur, which is presumptive
evidence that they do not intermix by breeding.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>No crayfishes are known to inhabit the rivers of the
northern Asiatic watershed, such as the Obi, Yenisei,
and Lena. None are known<a class="afnanc" href="#fn27" id="fnanc27">27</a>
in the sea of Aral, or the
great rivers Oxus and Jaxartes, which feed that vast
lake; nor any in the lakes of Balkash and Baikal. If
further exploration verifies this negative fact, it will be
not a little remarkable; inasmuch as two<a class="afnanc" href="#fn28" id="fnanc28">28</a>, if not more,
kinds of crayfishes are found in the basin of the great
river Amur, which drains a large area of north-eastern
Asia, and debouches into the Gulf of Tartary, in about
the latitude of York.</p>

<p>Japan has one species (<i>A. japonicus</i>), perhaps more;
but no crayfish has as yet been made known in any part
of eastern Asia, south of Amurland. There are certainly
none in Hindostan; none are known in Persia,
Arabia, or Syria. In Asia Minor the only recorded
locality is the Rion. No crayfish has yet been discovered
in the whole continent of Africa.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn29" id="fnanc29">29</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p305">{305}</span></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc27" id="fn27">27</a>
It would be hazardous, however, to assume that
none exist, especially in the Oxus, which formerly flowed
into the Caspian.</p>

Whatever the so-called <i>Astacus capensis</i> of
the Cape Colony may be, it is certainly not a crayfish.</p></div>

<p>Thus, on the continent of the old world, the crayfishes
are restricted to a zone, the southern limit of which
coincides with certain great geographical features; on
the west, the Mediterranean, with its continuation, the
Black Sea; then the range of the Caucasus, followed by
the great Asiatic highlands, as far as the Corea on the
east. On the north, though there is no such physical
boundary, the crayfishes appear to be entirely excluded
from the Siberian river basins; while east and west,
though a sea-barrier exists, the crayfishes extend beyond
it, to reach the British islands and those of Japan.</p>

<p>Crossing the Pacific, we meet with some
half-a-dozen kinds of crayfishes,<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn30" id="fnanc30">30</a> different from
those of the old world, but still belonging to the
genus <i>Astacus</i>, in British Columbia, Oregon, and
California. Beyond the Rocky Mountains, from the Great
Lakes to Guatemala, crayfishes abound, as many as
thirty-two different species having been described,
but they all belong to the genus <i>Cambarus</i> (fig. <a
href="#f63" title="go to &#x66;ig. 63">63</a>, p.
248). Species of this genus also occur in Cuba,<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn31" id="fnanc31">31</a>
but, so far as is at present known, not in any of
the other West Indian islands. The occurrence of a
curious dimorphism among the male <i>Cambari</i> has been
described by Dr. Hagen; and a blind <i>Cambarus</i> <span
class="xxpn" id="p306">{306}</span> is found, along
with other blind animals, in the subterranean caves of
Kentucky.</p>

Dr. Hagen in his “Monograph of the North

<p>All the crayfishes of the northern hemisphere belong
to the <i>Potamobiidæ</i>, and no members of this family are
known to exist south of the equator. The crayfishes of the
southern hemisphere, in fact, all belong to the division of
the <i>Parastacidæ</i>, and in respect of the number and variety
of forms and the size which they reach, the head-quarters
of the <i>Parastacidæ</i> is the continent of Australia. Some
of the Australian crayfishes (fig.
<a href="#f76" title="go to &#x66;ig. 76">76</a>) attain a foot or
more in length, and are as large as full-sized lobsters.
The genus <i>Engæus</i> of Tasmania comprises small crayfish
which, like some of the <i>Cambari</i>, live habitually on
land, in burrows which they excavate in the soil.</p>

<p>New Zealand has a peculiar genus of crayfishes,
<i>Paranephrops</i>, a species of which is found in the Fiji
Islands, but none are known to occur elsewhere in
Polynesia.</p>

<p>Two kinds of crayfish have been obtained in southern
Brazil, and have been described by Dr. v. Martens,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn32" id="fnanc32">32</a>
as
<i>A. pilimanus</i> and <i>A. brasiliensis</i>. I have shown that
they belong to a peculiar genus, <i>Parastacus</i>. The former
was procured at Porto Alegre, which is situated in 30°
S. Latitude, close to the mouth of the Jacuhy, at the
north end of the great Laguna
do Patos, which <span class="xxpn" id="p308">{308}</span>
communicates by a narrow passage with the sea; and also at Sta.
Cruz in the upper basin of the Rio Pardo, an affluent of
the Jacuhy, “by digging it out of holes in the ground.”
The latter (<i>P. brasiliensis</i>, fig.
<a href="#f64" title="go to &#x66;ig. 64">64</a>) was obtained at Porto
Alegre, and further inland, in the region of the primitive
forest at Rodersburg, in shallow streams.</p>

<p>In addition to these, no crayfish have as yet been
found in any of the great rivers, such as the Orinoko;
the Amazon, in which they were specially sought for by
Agassiz; or in the La Plata, on the eastern side of the

described in the “Histoire Naturelle des Crustacées,”
(vol. ii. p. 333). It is here stated that this crayfish
“habite les côtes du Chili,” but the freshwaters of the
Chilian coast are doubtless to be understood.</p>

<p>On comparing the results obtained by the study of the
geographical distribution of the crayfishes with those
brought to light by the examination of their morphological
characters, the important fact that there is a broad and
general correspondence between the two becomes apparent.
The wide equatorial belt of the earth’s surface
which separates the crayfishes of the northern from those
of the southern hemisphere, is a sort
of geographical <span class="xxpn" id="p310">{310}</span>
representation of the broad morphological differences
which mark off the <i>Potamobiidæ</i> from the <i>Parastacidæ</i>.
Each group occupies a definite area of the earth’s surface,
and the two are separated by an extensive border-land
untenanted by crayfishes.</p>

<p>A similar correspondence is exhibited, though less
distinctly, when we consider the distribution of the genera
and species of each group. Thus, among the <i>Potamobiidæ</i>,
<i>Astacus torrentium</i> and <i>nobilis</i> belong essentially
to the northern, western, and southern watersheds of
the central European highlands, the streams of which
flow respectively into the Baltic and the North Seas,
the Atlantic and the Mediterranean (fig.
<a href="#f77" title="go to &#x66;ig. 77">77</a>, I.); <i>A.
leptodactylus</i>, <i>pachypus</i>, <i>angulosus</i>, and <i>colchicus</i>,
appertain to the Pontocaspian watershed, the rivers of
which drain into the Black Sea and the Caspian (I.); while
<i>Astacus dauricus</i> and <i>A. Schrenckii</i> are restricted to
the widely separated basin of the Amur, which sheds its
waters into the Pacific (II.) The <i>Astaci</i> of the rivers of
western North America, which flow into the Pacific (IV.),
and the <i>Cambari</i> of the Eastern or Atlantic water-shed
(V.) are separated by the great physical barrier of
the Rocky Mountain ranges. Finally, with regard to the
<i>Parastacidæ</i>, the widely separated geographical regions
of New Zealand (VIII.), Australia (IX.), Madagascar
(XII.), and South America (VI. and VII.), are inhabited by
generically distinct groups.</p>

<p>But when we look more closely into the
matter, it will <span class="xxpn" id="p311">{311}</span>
be found that the parallel between the geographical and the
morphological facts cannot be quite strictly carried out.</p>

<p><i>Astacus torrentium</i>, as we have seen, inhabits both
the British Islands and the continent of Europe; nevertheless,
there is every reason to believe that twenty
miles of sea water is an insuperable barrier to the
passage of crayfishes from one land to the other. For
though some crayfishes live in brackish water, there is
no evidence that any existing species can maintain themselves
in the sea. A fact of the same character meets us
at the other side of the Eurasiatic continent, the Japanese
and the Amurland crayfishes being closely allied; although
it is not clear that there are any identical species on the
two sides of the Sea of Japan.</p>

<p>Another circumstance is still more remarkable. The
West American crayfishes are but little more different from
the Pontocaspian crayfishes, than these are from <i>Astacus
torrentium</i>. On the face of the matter, one might therefore
expect the Amurland and Japanese crayfishes, which
are intermediate in geographical position, to be also
intermediate, morphologically, between the Pontocaspian
and the West American forms. But this is not the
case. The branchial system of the Amurland <i>Astaci</i>
appears to be the same as that of the rest of the genus;
but, in the males, the third joint (ischiopodite) of the
second and third pair of ambulatory limbs is provided
with a conical, recurved, hook-like process; while, in the
females, the hinder edge of
the penultimate thoracic <span class="xxpn" id="p312">{312}</span>
sternum is elevated into a transverse prominence, on the
posterior face of which there is a pit or depression.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn34" id="fnanc34">34</a></p>

<p>In both these characters, but more especially in the
former, the Amurland and Japanese <i>Astaci</i> depart from
both the Pontocaspian and the West American <i>Astaci</i>,
and approach the <i>Cambari</i> of Eastern North America.</p>

<div class="dctr06" id="f78">

ischiopodite; <i>mp</i>, meropodite; <i>cp</i>, carpopodite;
<i>pp</i>, propodite; <i>dp</i>, dactylopodite.</div></div>

<p>In these crayfishes, in fact, one or both of the same
pairs of legs in the male are provided with similar
hook-like processes; while, in the females, the modification
of the penultimate thoracic sternum is carried
still further and gives rise to the curious structure described
by Dr. Hagen as the “annulus ventralis.”</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc34" id="fn34">34</a>
Kessler, l. c.</p></div>

<p>In all the <i>Cambari</i>, the pleurobranchiæ appear to be
entirely suppressed, and the hindermost podobranchia has
no lamina; while the areola is usually extremely narrow.
The proportional size of the areola
in the Amurland <span class="xxpn" id="p313">{313}</span>
crayfishes is not recorded; in the Japanese crayfish,
judging by the figure given by De Haan, it is about the
same as in the western <i>Astaci</i>. On the other hand, in
the West American crayfishes it is distinctly smaller; so
that, in this respect, they perhaps more nearly approach
the <i>Cambari</i>. Unfortunately, nothing is known as to
the branchiæ of the Amurland crayfishes. According
to De Haan, those of the Japanese species resemble
those of the western <i>Astaci</i>: as those of the West
American <i>Astaci</i> certainly do.</p>

<p>With respect to the <i>Parastacidcæ</i>; in the remarkable
length and flatness of the epistoma, the crayfishes of
Australia, Madagascar, and South America, resemble
one another. But in its peculiar truncated rostrum (see
fig.
<a href="#f65" title="go to &#x66;ig. 65">65</a>) and in the extreme modification of its branchial
system, which I have described elsewhere, the Madagascar
genus stands alone.</p>

<p>The <i>Paranephrops</i> of New Zealand and the Fijis, with
its wide and short epistoma, long rostrum, and large
antennary squames, is much more unlike the Australian
forms than might be expected from its geographical
position. On the other hand, considering their wide
separation by sea, the amount of resemblance between
the New Zealand and the Fiji species is very
remarkable.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>If the distribution of the crayfishes is compared
with that of terrestrial animals in general,
the points of <span class="xxpn" id="p314">{314}</span>
difference are at least as remarkable as the resemblances.</p>

<p>With respect to the latter, the area occupied by the
<i>Potamobiidæ</i>, corresponds roughly with the Palæarctic
and Nearctic divisions of the great Arctogæal provinces
of distribution indicated by mammals and birds; while
distinct groups of crayfishes occupy a larger or smaller
part of the other, namely, the Austro-Columbian, Australian,
and Novozelanian primary distributional provinces
of mammals and birds. Again, the peculiar
crayfishes of Madagascar answer to the special features
of the rest of the fauna of that island.</p>

<p>But the North American crayfishes extend much
further South than the limits of the Nearctic fauna in
general; while the absence of any group of crayfishes
in Africa, or in the rest of the old world, south of the
great Asiatic table-land, forms a strong contrast to the
general resemblance of the North African and Indian
fauna to that of the rest of Arctogæa. Again, there is
no such vast difference between the crayfishes of New
Zealand, Australia, and South America, as there is
between the mammals and the birds of those regions.</p>

<p>It may be concluded, therefore, that the conditions
which have determined the distribution of crayfishes have
been very different from those which have governed the
distribution of mammals and birds. But if we compare
with the distribution of the crayfishes, not that of terrestrial
animals in general, but only
that of freshwater <span class="xxpn" id="p315">{315}</span>
fishes, some very curious points of approximation become
manifest. The <i>Salmonidæ</i>, or fishes of the salmon and
trout kind, a few of which are exclusively marine, many
both marine and freshwater, while others are confined
to fresh water, are distributed over the northern hemisphere,
in a manner which recalls the distribution of
the Potamobine crayfishes,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn35" id="fnanc35">35</a>
though they do not extend
so far to the South in the new world, while they go a
little further, namely, as far as Algeria, Northern Asia
Minor, and Armenia, in the old world. With the exception
of the single genus <i>Retropinna</i>, which inhabits New
Zealand, no true salmonoid fish occurs south of the
equator; but, as Dr. Günther has pointed out, two
groups of freshwater fishes, the <i>Haplochitonidæ</i> and the
<i>Galaxidæ</i>, which stand in somewhat the same relation to
the <i>Salmonidæ</i> as the <i>Parastacidæ</i> do to the <i>Potamobiidæ</i>,
take the place of the <i>Salmonidæ</i> in the fresh waters of
New Zealand, Australia, and South America. There
are two species of <i>Haplochiton</i> in Tierra del Fuego; and
of the closely allied genus <i>Prototroctes</i>, one species is
found in South Australia, and one in New Zealand; of
the <i>Galaxidæ</i>, the same species, <i>Galaxias attennuatus</i>,
occurs in the streams of New Zealand, Tasmania, the
Falkland Islands, and Peru.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc35" id="fn35">35</a>
According to Dr. Günther their southern range
is similarly limited by the Asiatic Highlands. But they
abound in the rivers both of the old and new worlds which
flow into the Arctic sea; and though those on the western
side of the Rocky Mountains are different from the Eastern
American forms, yet there are species common to both the
Asiatic and the American coasts of the North Pacific.</p></div>

<p>Thus, these fish avoid South Africa,
as the crayfishes <span class="xxpn" id="p316">{316}</span>
do; but I am not aware that any member of the group is
found in Madagascar, and thus completes the analogy.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The preservation of the soft parts of animals in the
fossil state depends upon favourable conditions of rare
occurrence; and, in the case of the <i>Crustacea</i>, it is not
often that one can hope to meet with such small hard
parts as the abdominal members, in a good state of
preservation. But without recourse to the branchial
apparatus, and to the abdominal appendages, it might be
very difficult to say whether a given crustacean belonged
to the Astacine, or to the closely allied Homarine group.
Of course, if the accompanying fossils indicated that the
deposit in which the remains occur, was of freshwater
origin, the presumption in favour of their Astacine nature
would be very strong; but if they were inhabitants of the
sea, the problem whether the crustacean in question was
a marine Astacine, or a true Homarine, might be very
hard to solve.</p>

<p>Undoubted remains of crayfishes have hitherto been
discovered only in freshwater strata of late tertiary age.
In Idaho, North America, Professor Cope<a class="afnanc" href="#fn36" id="fnanc36">36</a>
found, in
association with <i>Mastodon mirificus</i>, and <i>Equus excelsus</i>,
several species, which he considers
to be distinct from <span class="xxpn" id="p317">{317}</span>
the existing American crayfishes; whether they are
<i>Cambari</i> or <i>Astaci</i> does not appear. But, in the lower
chalk of Ochtrup, in Westphalia, and therefore in a
marine deposit, Von der Marck and Schlüter<a class="afnanc" href="#fn37" id="fnanc37">37</a>
have
obtained a single, somewhat imperfect, specimen of a
crustacean, which they term <i>Astacus politus</i>, and which,
singularly enough, has the divided telson found only in
the genus <i>Astacus</i>. It would be very desirable to know
more about this interesting fossil. For the present it
affords a strong presumption that a marine Potamobine
existed as far back as the earlier part of the cretaceous
epoch.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Such are the more important facts of Morphology,
Physiology, and Distribution, which make up the sum
of our present knowledge of the Biology of Crayfishes.
The imperfection of that knowledge, especially as regards
the relations between Morphology and Distribution,
becomes a serious drawback when we attack the final
problem of Biology, which is to find out why animals
of such structure and active powers, and so localized,
exist?</p>

and 5.</p></div>

<p>It would appear difficult to frame more than two
fundamental hypotheses in attempting to solve this problem.
Either we must seek the origin of crayfishes in
conditions extraneous to the ordinary
course of natural <span class="xxpn" id="p318">{318}</span>
operations, by what is commonly termed Creation; or we
must seek for it in conditions afforded by the usual
course of nature, when the hypothesis assumes some
shape of the doctrine of Evolution. And there are two
forms of the latter hypothesis; for, it may be assumed,
on the one hand, that crayfishes have come into existence,
independently of any other form of living matter,
which is the hypothesis of spontaneous or equivocal
generation, or abiogenesis; or, on the other hand,
we may suppose that crayfishes have resulted from the
modification of some other form of living matter; and
this is what, to borrow a useful word from the French
language, is known as <i>transformism</i>.</p>

<p>I do not think that any hypothesis respecting the
origin of crayfishes can be suggested, which is not
referable to one or other of these, or to a combination
of them.</p>

<p>As regards the hypothesis of creation, little need be
said. From a scientific point of view, the adoption of
this speculation is the same thing as an admission that
the problem is not susceptible of solution. Moreover,
the proposition that a given thing has been created,
whether true or false, is not capable of proof. By
the nature of the case direct evidence of the fact is
not obtainable. The only indirect evidence is such
as amounts to proof that natural agencies are incompetent
to cause the existence of the thing in question.
But such evidence is out of our reach.
The most that <span class="xxpn" id="p319">{319}</span>
can be proved, in any case, is that no known natural
cause is competent to produce a given effect; and it is
an obvious blunder to confound the demonstration of our
own ignorance with a proof of the impotence of natural
causes. However, apart from the philosophical worthlessness
of the hypothesis of creation, it would be a waste
of time to discuss a view which no one upholds. And,
unless I am greatly mistaken, at the present day, no
one possessed of knowledge sufficient to give his opinion
importance is prepared to maintain that the ancestors of
the various species of crayfish were fabricated out of inorganic
matter, or brought from nothingness into being,
by a creative fiat.</p>

<p>Our only refuge, therefore, appears to be the hypothesis
of evolution. And, with respect to the doctrine
of abiogenesis, we may also, in view of a proper
economy of labour, postpone its discussion until such
time as the smallest fragment of evidence that a crayfish
can be evolved by natural agencies from not living matter,
is brought forward.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the hypothesis of transformism
remains in possession of the field; and the only profitable
inquiry is, how far are the facts susceptible of
interpretation, on the hypothesis that all the existing
kinds of crayfish are the product of the metamorphosis
of other forms of living beings; and that the biological
phenomena which they exhibit are the results
of the interaction, through past time, of
two series of <span class="xxpn" id="p320">{320}</span>
factors: the one, a process of morphological and concomitant
physiological modification; the other, a process
of change in the condition of the earth’s surface.</p>

<p>If we set aside, as not worth serious consideration, the
assumption that the <i>Astacus torrentium</i> of Britain was
originally created apart from the <i>Astacus torrentium</i> of
the Continent; it follows, either that this crayfish has
passed across the sea by voluntary or involuntary migration;
or that the <i>Astacus torrentium</i> existed before the
English Channel, and spread into England while these
islands were still continuous with the European mainland;
and that the present isolation of the English crayfishes
from the members of the same species on the
Continent is to be accounted for by those changes in the
physical geography of western Europe which, as there is
abundant evidence to prove, have separated the British
Islands from the mainland.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that our crayfish has been
purposely introduced by human agency into Great
Britain; and from the mode of life of crayfish and the
manner in which the eggs are carried about by the
parent during their development, transport by birds or
floating timber would seem to be out of the question.
Again, although <i>Astacus nobilis</i> is said to venture into
the brackish waters of the Gulf of Finland, and <i>A. leptodactylus</i>,
as we have seen, makes itself at home in the
more or less salt Caspian, there is no reason to believe
that <i>Astacus torrentium</i> is capable
of existing in <span class="xxpn" id="p321">{321}</span>
sea-water, still less of crossing the many miles of sea which
separate England from even the nearest point of the
Continent. In fact, the existence of the same kind of
crayfish on both sides of the Channel appears to be
only a case of the general truth, that the Fauna of the
British Islands is identical with a part of that of the
Continent; and as our foxes, badgers, and moles certainly
have neither swum across, nor been transported
by man, but existed in Britain while it was still continuous
with western Europe, and have been isolated
by the subsequent intervention of the sea, so we may
confidently explain the presence of <i>Astacus torrentium</i>
by reference to the same operation.</p>

<p>If we take into account the occurrence of <i>Astacus
nobilis</i> over so large a part of the area occupied by
<i>Astacus torrentium</i>; its absence in the British Islands,
and in Greece; and the closer affinity which exists between
<i>A. nobilis</i> and <i>A. leptodactylus</i>, than between <i>A.
nobilis</i> and <i>A. torrentium</i>; it seems not improbable that
Astacus torrentium was the original tenant of the whole
western European area outside the Ponto-Caspian watershed;
and that <i>A. nobilis</i> is an invading offshoot of the
Ponto-Caspian or <i>leptodactylus</i> form which has made its
way into the western rivers in the course of the many
changes of level which central Europe has undergone;
in the same way as <i>A. leptodactylus</i> is now passing into
the rivers of the Baltic provinces of Russia.</p>

<p>The study of the glacial phenomena
of central Europe <span class="xxpn" id="p322">{322}</span>
has led Sartorius von Waltershausen<a class="afnanc" href="#fn38" id="fnanc38">38</a>
to the conclusion
that at the time when the glaciers of the Alps had a
much greater extension than at present, a vast mass of
freshwater extended from the valley of the Danube to
that of the Rhone, around the northern escarpment of the
Alpine chain, and connected the head-waters of the
Danube with those of the Rhine, the Rhone, and the
northern Italian rivers. As the Danube debouches into
the Black Sea, and this was formerly connected with
the Aralo-Caspian Sea, an easy passage would thus be
opened up by which crayfishes might pass from the Aralo-Caspian
area to western Europe. If they spread by this
road, the <i>Astacus torrentium</i> may represent the first wave
of migration westward, while <i>A. nobilis</i> answers to a
second, and <i>A. leptodactylus</i>, with its varieties, remains
as the representative of the old Aralo-Caspian crayfishes.
And thus the crayfishes would present a curious parallel
with the Iberian, Aryan, and Mongoloid streams of westward
movement among mankind.</p>

<p>If we thus suppose the western Eurasiatic crayfishes
to be simply varieties of a primitive Aralo-Caspian stock,
their limitation to the south by the Mediterranean and by
the great Asiatic highlands becomes easily intelligible.</p>

<p>The extremely severe climatal conditions which obtain
in northern Siberia may sufficiently
account for the <span class="xxpn" id="p323">{323}</span>
absence of crayfishes (if they are really absent) in the
rivers Obi, Yenisei, and Lena, and in the great lake
Baikal, which lies more than 1,300 feet above the sea,
and is frozen over from November to May. Moreover,
there can be no doubt that, at a comparatively recent
period, the whole of this region, from the Baltic to the
mouth of the Lena, was submerged beneath a southward
extension of the waters of the Arctic ocean to the Aralo-Caspian
Sea and Lake Baikal, and a westward extension
to the Gulf of Finland.</p>

<p>The great lakes and inland seas which stretch, at
intervals, from Baikal, on the east, to Wenner in Sweden,
on the west, are simply pools, isolated partly by the rising
of the ancient sea-bottom and partly by evaporation; and
often completely converted into fresh water by the inflow
of the surrounding land-drainage. But the population
of these pools was originally the same as that of the
Northern Ocean, and a few species of marine crustaceans,
mollusks, and fish, besides seals, remain in them as
living evidences of the great change which has taken place.
The same process which, as we shall see, has isolated
the <i>Mysis</i> of the Arctic seas in the lakes of Sweden and
Finland, has shut up with it other arctic marine crustacea,
such as species of <i>Gammarus</i> and <i>Idothea</i>. And the very
same species of <i>Gammarus</i> is imprisoned, along with
arctic seals, in the waters of Lake Baikal.</p>

<p>The distribution of the American crayfishes agrees
equally well with the hypothesis of the
northern origin of <span class="xxpn" id="p324">{324}</span>
the stock from which they have been evolved. Even
under existing geographical conditions, an affluent of the
Mississippi, the St. Peter’s river, communicates directly,
in rainy weather, with the Red river, which flows into
Lake Winnipeg, the southernmost of the long series of
intercommunicating lakes and streams, which occupy the
low and flat water-parting between the southern and the
northern watersheds of the North American Continent.
But the northernmost of these, the Great Slave Lake,
empties itself by the Mackenzie river into the Arctic
Ocean, and thus provides a route by which crayfishes
might spread from the north over all parts of North
America east of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>The so-called Rocky Mountain range is, in reality, an
immense table-land, the edges of which are fringed by two
principal lines of mountainous elevations. The table-land
itself occupies the place of a great north and south
depression which, in the cretaceous epoch, was occupied by
the sea and probably communicated with the ocean at its
northern, as well as at its southern end. During and
since this epoch it became gradually filled up, and it
now contains an immense thickness of deposits of all
ages from the cretaceous to the pliocene—the earlier
marine, the later more and more completely freshwater.
During the tertiary epoch, various portions of this area
have been occupied by vast lakes, the more northern of
which doubtless had outlets into the Northern sea. That
crayfish existed in the vicinity of
the Rocky Mountains <span class="xxpn" id="p325">{325}</span>
in the latter part of the tertiary epoch is testified by the
Idaho fossils. And there is thus no difficulty in understanding
their presence in the rivers which have now cut
their way to the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>The similarity of the crayfish of the Amurland and of
Japan is a fact of the same order as the identity of the
English crayfish with the <i>Astacus torrentium</i> of the European
Continent, and is to be explained in an analogous
fashion. For there can be no doubt that the Asiatic
continent formerly extended much further to the eastward
than it does at present, and included what are now
the islands of Japan. Even with this alteration of the
geographical conditions, however, it is not easy to see
how crayfishes can have got into the Amur-Japanese
fresh waters. For a north-eastern prolongation of the
Asiatic highlands, which ends to the north in the Stanovoi
range, shuts in the Amur basin on the west; while
the Amur debouches into the sea of Okhotsk, and the
Pacific ocean washes the shores of the Japanese islands.</p>

<p>But there are many grounds for the conclusion that, in
the latter half of the tertiary epoch, eastern Asia and
North America were connected, and that the chain of the
Kurile and Aleutian islands may indicate the position of
a great extent of submerged land. In that case, the sea
of Okhotsk and Behring’s sea may occupy the site of
inland waters which formerly placed the mouth of the
Amur in direct communication with the Northern Ocean,
just as the Black Sea, at present, brings the
basin of the <span class="xxpn" id="p326">{326}</span>
Danube into connection, first with the Mediterranean and
then with the western Atlantic; and, as in former times,
it gave access from the south to the vast area now
drained by the Volga. When the Black Sea communicated
with the Aralo-Caspian sea, and this opened to
the north into the Arctic sea, a chain of great inland
waters must have skirted the eastern frontier of Europe,
just such as would now lie on the eastern frontier of Asia
if the present coast underwent elevation.</p>

<p>Supposing, however, that the ancestral forms of the
<i>Potamobiidæ</i> obtained access to the river basins in which
they are now found, from the north, the hypothesis that
a mass of fresh water once occupied a great part of the
region which is now Siberia and the Arctic Ocean, would
be hardly tenable, and it is, in fact, wholly unnecessary
for our present purpose.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the stalk-eyed crustaceans are, and
always have been, exclusively marine animals; the crayfishes,
the <i>Atyidæ</i>, and the fluviatile crabs (<i>Thelphusidæ</i>),
being the only considerable groups among them which
habitually confine themselves to fresh waters. But
even in such a genus as <i>Penæus</i>, most of the species
of which are exclusively marine, some, such as <i>Penæus
brasiliensis</i>, ascend rivers for long distances. Moreover,
there are cases in which it cannot be doubted
that the descendants of marine <i>Crustacea</i> have gradually
accustomed themselves to fresh water conditions, and
have, at the same time, become more
or less modified, <span class="xxpn" id="p327">{327}</span>
so that they are no longer absolutely identical with those
descendants of their ancestors which have continued to
live in the sea.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn39" id="fnanc39">39</a></p>

<p>In several of the lakes of Norway, Sweden and
Finland, and in Lake Ladoga, in Northern Europe; in
Lake Superior and Lake Michigan, in North America;
a small crustacean, <i>Mysis relicta</i>, occurs in such abundance
as to furnish a great part of the supply of food to
the fresh water fishes which inhabit these lakes. Now,
this <i>Mysis relicta</i> is hardly distinguishable from the
<i>Mysis oculata</i> which inhabits the Arctic seas, and is
certainly nothing but a slight variety of that species.</p>

<p>In the case of the lakes of Norway and Sweden, there
is independent evidence that they formerly communicated
with the Baltic, and were, in fact, fiords or arms of the
sea. The communication of these fiords with the sea
having been gradually cut off, the marine animals they
contained have been imprisoned; and as the water has
been slowly changed from salt to fresh by the drainage
of the surrounding land, only those which were able to
withstand the altered conditions have survived. Among
these is the <i>Mysis oculata</i>, which has in the meanwhile
undergone the slight variation which has converted it
into <i>Mysis relicta</i>. Whether
the same explanation <span class="xxpn" id="p328">{328}</span>
applies to Lakes Superior and Michigan, or whether the
<i>Mysis oculata</i> has not passed into these masses of fresh
water by channels of communication with the Arctic
Ocean which no longer exist, is a secondary question.
The fact remains that <i>Mysis relicta</i> is a primitively
marine animal which has become completely adapted to
fresh-water life.</p>

<p>Several species of prawns (<i>Palæmon</i>) abound in our
own seas. Other marine prawns are found on the coasts
of North America, in the Mediterranean, in the South
Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and in the Pacific as far
south as New Zealand. But species of the same genus
(<i>Palæmon</i>) are met with, living altogether in fresh water,
in Lake Erie, in the rivers of Florida, in the Ohio, in
the rivers of the Gulf of Mexico, of the West India
Islands and of eastern South America, as far as southern
Brazil, if not further; in those of Chili and those of
Costa Rica in western South America; in the Upper
Nile, in West Africa, in Natal, in the Islands of Johanna,
Mauritius, and Bourbon, in the Ganges, in the Molucca
and Philippine Islands, and probably elsewhere.</p>

<p>Many of these fluviatile prawns differ from the marine
species not only in their great size (some attaining a foot
or more in length), but still more remarkably in the vast
development of the fifth pair of thoracic appendages.
These are always larger than the slender fourth pair
(which answer to the forceps of the crayfishes); and, in
the males especially, they are very long
and strong, and <span class="xxpn" id="p329">{329}</span>
are terminated by great chelæ, not unlike those of the
crayfishes. Hence these fluviatile prawns (known in
many places by the name of “Cammarons”) are not
unfrequently confounded with true crayfishes; though
the fact that there are only three pair of ordinary legs
behind the largest, forceps-like pair, is sufficient at once
to distinguish them from any of the <i>Astacidæ</i>.</p>

appendage of male.</div></div>

<p>Species of these large-clawed prawns
live in the <span class="xxpn" id="p330">{330}</span>
brackish water lagoons of the Gulf of Mexico, but I
am not aware that any of them have yet been met with
in the sea itself. The <i>Palæmon lacustris</i> (<i>Anchistia
migratoria</i>, Heller) abounds in fresh-water ditches and
canals between Padua and Venice, and in the Lago di
Garda, as well as in the brooks of Dalmatia; but its
occurrence in the Adriatic or the Mediterranean, which
has been asserted, appears to be doubtful. So the Nile
prawn, though very similar to some Mediterranean
prawns, does not seem to be identical with any at
present known.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn40" id="fnanc40">40</a></p>

<p>In all these cases, it appears reasonable to apply the
analogy of the <i>Mysis relicta</i>, and to suppose that the
fluviatile prawns are simply the result of the adaptive
modification of species which, like their congeners, were
primitively marine.</p>

<p>But if the existing sea prawns were to die out,
or to be beaten in the struggle for existence, we
should have, scattered over the world in isolated
river basins, more or less distinct species of
freshwater prawns,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn41"
id="fnanc41">41</a> the areas inhabited by which might
hereafter be indefinitely enlarged or diminished, by
alteration in the elevation of the <span class="xxpn"
id="p331">{331}</span> land and by other changes
in physical geography. And, indeed, under these
circumstances, the freshwater prawns themselves might
become so much modified, that, even if the descendants
of their ancestors remained unchanged in structure and
habits in the sea, the relationship of the two might
no longer be obvious.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc"><a class="afnlabel"
href="#fnanc41" id="fn41">41</a> This seems actually
to have happened in the case of the widely-spread
allies and companions of the fluviatile prawns, <i>Atya</i>
and <i>Caridina</i>. I am not aware that truly marine
species of these genera are known.</p></div>

<p>These considerations appear to me to indicate the direction
in which we must look for a rational explanation
of the origin of crayfishes and their present distribution.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that they are derived from ancestors
which lived altogether in the sea, as the great majority of
the <i>Mysidæ</i> and many of the prawns do now; and that, of
these ancestral crayfishes, there were some which, like
<i>Mysis oculata</i> or <i>Penæus brasiliensis</i>, readily adapted themselves
to fresh water conditions, ascended rivers, and took
possession of lakes. These, more or less modified, have
given rise to the existing crayfishes, while the primitive
stock would seem to have vanished. At any rate, at the
present time, no marine crustacean with the characters
of the <i>Astacidæ</i> is known.</p>

<p>As crayfishes have been found in the later tertiaries
of North America, we shall hardly err in dating the
existence of these marine crayfishes at least as far back
as the miocene epoch; and I am disposed to think that,
during the earlier tertiary and later mesozoic periods,
these <i>Crustacea</i> not only had as wide a distribution as
the Prawns and <i>Penæi</i> have now, but were differentiated
into two groups, one with the general
characters of the <span class="xxpn" id="p332">{332}</span>
<i>Potamobiidæ</i> in the northern hemisphere, and another,
with those of the <i>Parastacidæ</i>, in the southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>The ancestral Potamobine form probably presented
the peculiarities of the <i>Potamobiidæ</i> in a less marked
degree than any existing species does. Probably the
four pleurobranchiæ were all equally well developed; the
laminæ of the podobranchiæ smaller and less distinct
from the stem; the first and second abdominal appendages
less specialised; and the telson less distinctly
divided. So far as the type was less specially Potamobine,
it must have approached the common form in
which <i>Homarus</i> and <i>Nephrops</i> originated. And it is
to be remarked that these also are exclusively confined
to the northern hemisphere.</p>

<p>The wide range and close affinity of the genera
<i>Astacus</i> and <i>Cambarus</i> appear to me to necessitate the
supposition that they are derived from some one already
specialised Potamobine form; and I have already mentioned
the grounds upon which I am disposed to believe
that this ancestral Potamobine existed in the sea which
lay north of the miocene continent in the northern
hemisphere.</p>

<p>In the marine primitive crayfishes south of the equator,
the branchial apparatus appears to have suffered less
modification, while the suppression of the first abdominal
appendages, in both sexes, has its analogue among the
<i>Palinuridæ</i>, the headquarters of which are in the
southern hemisphere. That they
should have ascended <span class="xxpn" id="p333">{333}</span>
the rivers of New Zealand, Australia, Madagascar, and
South America, and become fresh water <i>Parastacidæ</i>, is
an assumption which is justified by the analogy of the
fresh-water prawns. It remains to be seen whether
marine <i>Parastacidæ</i> still remain in the South Pacific
and Atlantic Oceans, or whether they have become
extinct.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In speculating upon the causes of an effect which is
the product of several co-operating factors, the nature
of each of which has to be divined by reasoning backwards
from its effects, the probability of falling into
error is very great. And this probability is enhanced
when, as in the present case, the effect in question
consists of a multitude of phenomena of structure and
distribution about which much is yet imperfectly known.
Hence the preceding discussion must rather be regarded
as an illustration of the sort of argumentation by which
a completely satisfactory theory of the ætiology of the
crayfish will some day be established, than as sufficing
to construct such a theory. It must be admitted that
it does not account for the whole of the positive facts
which have been ascertained; and that it requires supplementing,
in order to furnish even a plausible explanation
of various negative facts.</p>

<p>The positive fact which presents a difficulty is the
closer resemblance between the Amur-Japanese crayfish
and the East American <i>Cambari</i>,
than between the <span class="xxpn" id="p334">{334}</span>
latter and the West American <i>Astaci</i>; and the closer
resemblance between the latter and the Pontocaspian
crayfish, than either bear to the Amur-Japanese form.
If the facts had been the other way, and the West
American and Amur-Japanese crayfish had changed
places, the case would have been intelligible enough.
The primitive Potamobine stock might then have been
supposed to have differentiated itself into a western
astacoid, and an eastern cambaroid form;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn42" id="fnanc42">42</a>
the latter
would have ascended the American, and the former the
Asiatic rivers. As the matter stands, I do not see that
any plausible explanation can be offered without recourse
to suppositions respecting a former more direct communication
between the mouth of the Amur, and that
of the North American rivers, in favour of which no
definite evidence can be offered at present.</p>

<p>The most important negative fact which remains to
be accounted for is the absence of crayfishes in the
rivers of a large moiety of the continental lands, and in
numerous islands. Differences of climatal conditions are
obviously inadequate to account for the absence of crayfishes
in Jamaica, when they are present in Cuba; for
their absence in Mozambique, and the islands of Johanna
and Mauritius, when they are present in Madagascar;
and for their absence in the Nile, when they exist in
Guatemala. <span class="xxpn" id="p335">{335}</span></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc42" id="fn42">42</a>
Just as there is an American form of <i>Idothea</i> and an Asiatic form
in the Arctic ocean at the present day.</p></div>

<p>At present, I confess that I do not see my way to a
perfectly satisfactory explanation of the absence of crayfishes
in so many parts of the world in which they
mighty <i>à priori</i>, be expected to exist; and I can only
suggest the directions in which an explanation may be
sought.</p>

<p>The first of these is the existence of physical obstacles
to the spread of crayfishes, at the time at which the
Potamobine and the Parastacine stocks respectively began
to take possession of the rivers, some of which have
now ceased to exist; and the second is the probability
that, in many rivers which have been accessible to crayfishes,
the ground was already held by more powerful
competitors.</p>

<p>If the ancestors of the Potamobine crayfishes originated
only among those primitive crayfishes which inhabited the
seas north of the miocene continent, their present limitation
to the south, in the old world, is as easily intelligible
as is their extension southward, in the course of the river
basins of Northern America as far as Guatemala, but
no further. For the elevation of the Eurasiatic highlands
had commenced in the miocene epoch, while the
isthmus of Panama was interrupted by the sea.</p>

<p>With respect to the Southern hemisphere, the absence
of crayfishes in Mauritius and in the islands of the Indian
Ocean, though they occur in Madagascar, may be due
to the fact that the former islands are of comparatively
late volcanic origin; while Madagascar is
the remnant of <span class="xxpn" id="p336">{336}</span>
a very ancient continental area, the oldest indigenous
population of which, in all probability, is directly descended
from that which occupied it at the beginning
of the tertiary epoch. If Parastacine <i>Crustacea</i> inhabited
the southern hemisphere at this period, and subsequently
became extinct as marine animals, their preservation in
the freshwaters of Australia, New Zealand, and the older
portions of South America may be understood. The
difficulty of the absence of crayfishes in South Africa<a class="afnanc" href="#fn43" id="fnanc43">43</a>
remains; and all that can be said is, that it is a difficulty
of the same nature as that which confronts us when we
compare the fauna of South Africa in general with that
of Madagascar. The population of the latter region has
a more ancient aspect than that of the former; and it
may be that South Africa, in its present shape, is of very
much later date than Madagascar.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc43" id="fn43">43</a>
But it must be remembered that we have as
yet everything to learn respecting the fauna of the great
inland lakes and river systems of South Africa.</p></div>

<p>With respect to the second point for consideration, it
is to be remarked that, in the temperate regions of the
world, the crayfishes are by far the largest and strongest
of any of the inhabitants of freshwater, except the <i>Vertebrata</i>;
and that while frogs and the like fall an easy prey
to them, they must be formidable enemies and competitors
even to fishes, aquatic reptiles, and the smaller
aquatic mammals. In warm climates, however, not only
the large prawns which have been
mentioned, but <i>Atyæ</i> <span class="xxpn" id="p337">{337}</span>
and fluviatile crabs (<i>Thelphusa</i>) compete for the possession
of the freshwaters; and it is not improbable that
under some circumstances, they may be more than a
match for crayfishes; so that the latter might either be
driven out of territory they already occupied, as <i>Astacus
leptodactylus</i> is driving out <i>A. nobilis</i> in the Russian
rivers; or might be prevented from entering rivers already
tenanted by their rivals.</p>

<p>In connection with this speculation, it is worthy of
remark that the area occupied by the fluviatile crabs is
very nearly the same as that zone of the earth’s surface
from which crayfish are excluded, or in which they are
scanty. That is to say, they are found in the hotter
parts of the eastern side of the two Americas, the West
Indies, Africa, Madagascar, Southern Italy, Turkey and
Greece, Hindostan, Burmah, China, Japan, and the
Sandwich Islands. The large-clawed fluviatile prawns
are found in the same regions of America, on both
east and west coasts, in Africa, Southern Asia, the
Moluccas, and the Philippine Islands; while the <i>Atyidæ</i>
not only cover the same area, but reach Japan, extend
over Polynesia, to the Sandwich Islands, on the north,
and New Zealand, on the south, and are found on both
shores of the Mediterranean; a blind form (<i>Troglocaris
Schmidtii</i>), in the Adelsberg caves, representing the blind
<i>Cambarus</i> of the caves of Kentucky.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The hypothesis respecting the
origin of crayfishes <span class="xxpn" id="p338">{338}</span>
which has been tentatively put forward in the preceding
pages, involves the assumption that marine Crustacea of
the astacine type were in existence during the deposition
of the middle tertiary formations, when the great continents
began to assume their present shape. That
such was the case there can be no doubt, inasmuch as
abundant remains of Crustacea of that type occur still
earlier in the mesozoic rocks. They prove the existence
of ancient crustaceans, from which the crayfishes may have
been derived, at that period of the earth’s history when
the conformation of the land and sea were such as to
admit of their entering the regions in which we now find
them.</p>

<p>The materials which have, up to the present, time been
collected are too scanty to permit of the tracing out of all
the details of the genealogy of the crayfish. Nevertheless,
the evidence which exists is perfectly clear, as far as it
goes, and is in complete accordance with the requirements
of the doctrine of evolution.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of the close affinity between
the crayfishes and the lobsters—the <i>Astacina</i> and the <i>Homarina</i>;
and it fortunately happens that these two groups,
which may be included under the common name of the
<i>Astacomorpha</i>, are readily distinguishable from all the
other <i>Podophthalmia</i> by peculiarities of their exoskeleton
which are readily seen in all well-preserved fossils.
In all, as in the crayfish, there are large forceps, followed
by two pairs of chelate
ambulatory limbs, while <span class="xxpn" id="p339">{339}</span>
the succeeding two pairs of legs are terminated by simple
claws. The exopodite of the last abdominal appendage
is divided into two parts by a transverse suture. The
pleura of the second abdominal somite are larger than
the others, and overlap those of the first somite,
which are very small. Any fossil crustacean which
presents all these characters, is certainly one of the
<i>Astacomorpha</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Astacina</i>, again, are distinguished from the <i>Homarina</i>
by the mobility of the last thoracic somite, and the
characters of the first and second abdominal appendages,
when they are present; or by their entire absence.
But it is so difficult to make out anything about either
of these characters in fossils, that, so far as I am aware,
we know nothing about them in any fossil Astacomorph.
And hence, it may be impossible to say to which division
any given form belongs, unless its resemblances to
known types are so minute and so close as to remove
doubt.</p>

<p>For the present purpose, the series of the fossiliferous
rocks may be grouped as follows:—1. Recent and
Quaternary. 2. Newer Tertiary (Pliocene and Miocene).
3. Older Tertiary (Eocene). 4. Cretaceous (Chalk,
Greensand and Gault). 5. Wealden. 6. Jurassic (Purbeck
to Inferior Oolite). 7. Liassic. 8. Triassic. 9.
Permian. 10. Carboniferous. 11. Devonian. 12.
Silurian. 13. Cambrian.</p>

<p>Now the oldest known member of the
group of the <span class="xxpn" id="p341">{341}</span>
decapod <i>Podophthalmia</i> to which the <i>Astacomorpha</i> belong
occurs in the Carboniferous formation. It is the genus
<i>Anthrapalæmon</i>—a small and very curious crustacean,
about which nothing more need be said at present, as it
does not appear to have special affinities with the <i>Astacomorpha</i>.
In the later formations, up to the top of the
Trias, podophthalmatous <i>Crustacea</i> are very rare; and,
unless the Triassic genus <i>Pemphix</i> is an exception, no
Astacomorphs are known to occur in them. The specimens
of <i>Pemphix</i> which I have examined are not sufficiently
complete to enable me to express any opinion
about them.</p>

<p>The case is altered when we reach the Middle Lias. In
fact this yields several forms of a genus, <i>Eryma</i> (fig.
<a href="#f80" title="go to &#x66;ig. 80">80</a>, B),
which also occurs in the overlying strata almost up to the
top of the Jurassic series, and presents so many variations
that nearly forty different species have been recognised.
<i>Eryma</i> is, in all respects, an Astacomorph, and so far as
can be seen, it differs from the existing genera only
in such respects as those in which they differ from
one another. Thus it is quite certain that Astacomorphous
<i>Crustacea</i> have existed since a period so remote
as the older part of the Mesozoic period; and any hesitation
in admitting this singular persistency of type on
the part of the crayfishes, is at once removed by the
consideration of the fact that, along with <i>Eryma</i>, in the
Middle Lias, prawn-like <i>Crustacea</i>, generically identical
with the existing <i>Penæus</i>, flourished
in the sea <span class="xxpn" id="p342">{342}</span>
and left their remains in the mud of the ancient sea
bottom.</p>

<p><i>Eryma</i> is the only crustacean, which can be certainly
ascribed to the <i>Astacomorpha</i>, that has hitherto been
found in the strata from the Middle Lias to the lithographic
slates; which last lie in the upper part of the
Jurassic series. In the freshwater beds of the Wealden,
no <i>Astacomorpha</i> are known, and although no very great
weight is to be attached to a negative fact of this kind, it
is, so far, evidence that the <i>Astacomorpha</i> had not yet
taken to freshwater life. In the marine deposits of the
Cretaceous epoch, however,
astacomorphous forms, which <span class="xxpn" id="p343">{343}</span>
are known by the generic names of <i>Hoploparia</i> and
<i>Enoploclytia</i>, are abundant.</p>

<p>The differences between these two genera, and between
both and <i>Eryma</i>, are altogether insignificant from a broad
morphological point of view. They appear to me to be
of less importance than those which obtain between the
different existing genera of crayfishes.</p>

<p><i>Hoploparia</i> is found in the London clay. It therefore
extends beyond the bounds of the Mesozoic epoch into
the older Tertiary. But when this genus is compared
with the existing <i>Homarus</i> and <i>Nephrops</i>, it is found
partly to resemble the one and partly the other. Thus,
on one line, the actual series of forms which have
succeeded one another from the Liassic epoch to the
present day, is such as must have existed if the common
lobster and the Norway lobster are the descendants of
<i>Erymoid</i> crustaceans which inhabited the seas of the
Liassic epoch.</p>

<p>Side by side with <i>Eryma</i>, in the lithographic slates,
there is a genus, <i>Pseudastacus</i> (fig.
<a href="#f80" title="go to &#x66;ig. 80">80</a>, A), which, as its
name implies, has an extraordinarily close resemblance to
the crayfishes of the present day. Indeed there is no point
of any importance in which (in the absence of any knowledge
of the abdominal appendages in the males) it differs
from them. On the other hand, in some features, as in the
structure of the carapace, it differs from <i>Eryma</i>, much
as the existing crayfishes differ from <i>Nephrops</i>. Thus, in
the latter part of the Jurassic epoch,
the Astacine type <span class="xxpn" id="p344">{344}</span>
was already distinct from the Homarine type, though
both were marine; and, since <i>Eryma</i> begins at least
as early as the Middle Lias, it is possible that <i>Pseudastacus</i>
goes back as far, and that the common protastacine
form is to be sought in the Trias. <i>Pseudastacus</i>
is found in the marine cretaceous rocks of the Lebanon,
but has not yet been traced into the Tertiary
formations.</p>

<p>I am disposed to think that <i>Pseudastacus</i> is comparable
to such a form as <i>Astacus nigrescens</i> rather than to any
of the <i>Parastacidæ</i>, as I doubt the existence of the latter
group at any time in northern latitudes.</p>

<p>In the chalk of Westphalia (also a marine deposit) a
single specimen of another Astacomorph has been discovered,
which possesses an especial interest as it is
a true <i>Astacus</i> (<i>A. politus</i>, Von der Marck and Schlüter),
provided with the characteristic transversely divided
telson which is found in the majority of the <i>Potamobiidæ</i>.</p>

<p>If we arrange the results of palæontological
inquiry which have now been stated in the form of a
table such as that which is given on the following
page, the significance of the succession of
astacomorphous forms, in time, becomes apparent. <span

<img src="images/i345.png"

<p>If an Astacomorphous crustacean, having characters
intermediate between those of <i>Eryma</i> and those of
<i>Pseudastacus</i>, existed in the Triassic epoch or earlier;
if it gradually diverged into Pseudastacine and Erymoid
forms; if these again took on
Astacine and Homarine <span class="xxpn" id="p346">{346}</span>
characters, and finally ended in the existing <i>Potamobiidæ</i>
and <i>Homarina</i>, the fossil forms left in the track of this
process of evolution would be very much what they
actually are. Up to the end of the Mesozoic epoch
the only known <i>Potamobiidæ</i> are marine animals. And
we have already seen that the facts of distribution
suggest the hypothesis that they must have been so,
at least up to this time.</p>

<p>Thus, with respect to the Ætiology of the crayfishes,
all the known facts are in harmony with the requirements
of the hypothesis that they have been gradually evolved
in the course of the Mesozoic and subsequent epochs
of the world’s history from a primitive Astacomorphous
form.</p>

<p>And it is well to reflect that the only alternative supposition
is, that these numerous successive and coexistent
forms of insignificant animals, the differences of which
require careful study for their discrimination, have been
separately and independently fabricated, and put into the
localities in which we find them. By whatever verbal fog
the question at issue may be hidden, this is the real
nature of the dilemma presented to us not only by the
crayfish, but by every animal and by every plant; from
man to the humblest animalcule; from the spreading
beech and towering pine to the <i>Micrococci</i> which lie at
the limit of microscopic visibility.</p>

<span class="h3lg">
THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE EXOSKELETON.</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">The harder parts of the exoskeleton
of the crayfish contain rather more than half
their weight of calcareous salts. Of these nearly
seven-eighths consist of carbonate of lime, the rest
being phosphate of lime.</p>

<p>The animal matter consists for the most part of
a peculiar substance termed <i>Chitin</i>, which enters
into the composition of the hard parts not only
of the <i>Arthropoda</i> in general but of many other
invertebrated animals. Chitin is not dissolved even
by hot caustic alkalies, whence the use of solutions
of caustic potash and soda in cleaning the skeletons
of crayfishes. It is soluble in cold concentrated
hydrochloric acid without change, and may be
precipitated from its solution by the addition of
water.</p>

<p>Chitin contains nitrogen, and according
to the latest investigations (Ledderhose,
“Ueber Chitin und seine Spaltungs-produkte:”
Zeitschrift für Physiologische Chemie, II. 1879)
its composition is represented by the formula
C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>26</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>10</sub>&#x202f;.</p>

<span class="h3lg">
THE CRAB’S EYES, OR GASTROLITHS.</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">The “Gastroliths,” as the “crab’s eyes” may be termed, are found
fully developed only in the latter part of the summer season, just before
ecdysis sets in. They then give rise to rounded
prominences, one on <span class="xxpn" id="p348">{348}</span>
each side of the anterior part of the cardiac division of the stomach. The
proper wall of the stomach is continued over the outer surface of the
prominence; and, in fact, forms the outer wall of the chamber in which
the gastrolith is contained, the inner wall being formed by the cuticular
lining of the stomach. When the outer wall is cut through, it is
readily detached from the convex outer surface of the gastrolith, with
which it is in close contact. The inner surface of the gastrolith is usually
flat or slightly concave. Sometimes it is strongly adherent to the chitonous
cuticula; but when fully formed it is readily detached from the
latter. Thus the proper wall of the stomach invests only the outer face
of the gastrolith, the inner face of which is adherent to, or at any rate in
close contact with, the cuticula. The gastrolith is by no means a mere
concretion, but is a cuticular growth, having a definite structure. Its
inner surface is smooth, but the outer surface is rough, from the projection
of irregular ridges which form a kind of meshwork. A vertical section
shows that it is composed of thin superimposed layers, of which the
inner are parallel with the flat inner surface, while the outer becomes
gradually concentric with the outer surface. Moreover, the inner layers
are less calcified than the outer, the projections of the outer surface being
particularly dense and hard. In fact, the gastroliths are very similar to
other hard parts of the exoskeleton in structure, except that the densest
layers are nearest the epithelial substratum, instead of furthest away
from it.</p>

<p>When ecdysis occurs, the gastroliths are cast off along with the gastric
armature in general, into the cavity of the stomach, and are there
dissolved, a new cuticle being formed external to them from the proper
wall of the stomach. The dissolved calcareous matter is probably used
up in the formation of the new exoskeleton.</p>

<p>According to the observations of M. Chantran (Comptes Rendus,
LXXVIII. 1874) the gastroliths begin to be formed about forty days
before ecdysis takes place in crayfish of four years’ old; but the
interval is less in younger crayfish, and is not more than ten days
during the first year after birth. When shed into the stomach during
ecdysis they are ground down, not merely dissolved. The process
of destruction and absorption takes twenty-four to thirty hours
in very young crayfish, seventy to eighty hours in adults. Unless
the gastroliths are normally developed and re-absorbed, ecdysis is
not healthily effected, and the crayfish dies in the course of the
process. <span class="xxpn" id="p349">{349}</span></p>

<p>According to Dulk (“Chemische Untersuchung der
Krebsteine:” Müller’s Archiv. 1835), the gastroliths
have the following composition:—</p>

GROWTH OF CRAYFISH.</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">The statements in the text, after the words “By the end of the year,”
regarding the sizes of the crayfish at different ages, are given on the
authority of M. Carbonnier (L’Écrevisse. Paris, 1869); but they obviously
apply only to the large “Écrevisse à pieds rouges” of France, and not to
the English crayfish, which appears to be identical with the “Écrevisse
à pieds blancs,” and is of much smaller size. According to M. Carbonnier
(l. c. p. 51), the young crayfish just born is “un centimètre et demi
environ,” that is to say, three-fifths of an inch long. The young of the
English crayfish still attached to the mother, which I have seen, rarely
exceeds half this length.</p>

<p>M. Soubeiran (“Sur l’histoire naturelle et l’education des Écrevisses:”
Comptes Rendus, LX. 1865) gives the result of his study of the growth
of the crayfishes reared at Clairefontaine, near Rambouillet, in the
following table:</p>

<span class="h3lg">
THE ECDYSES OF CRAYFISHES.</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">There is a good deal of discrepancy between different observers as to
the frequency of the process of ecdysis in crayfishes. In the text I have
followed M. Carbonnier, but M. Chantran (“Observations sur l’histoire
naturelle des Écrevisses:” Comptes Rendus, LXXI. 1870, and LXXIII.
1871), who appears to have studied the question (on the “écrevisse
à pieds rouges” apparently) very carefully, declares that the young
crayfish moults no fewer than eight times in the course of the first twelve
months. The first moult takes place ten days after it is hatched; the
second, third, fourth, and fifth, at intervals of from twenty to twenty-five
days, so that the young animal moults five times in the course of the
ninety to one hundred days of July, August, and September. From the
latter month to the end of April in the following year, no ecdysis takes
place. The sixth takes place in May, the seventh in June, and the eighth
in July. In the second year of its age, the crayfish moults five times, that
is to say, in August and in September, and in May, June, and July
following. In the third year, the crayfish commonly moults only twice,
namely in July and in September. At a greater age than this, the
females moult only once a year, from August to September; while the
males moult twice, first in June and July; afterwards in August and
September.</p>

<p>The details of the process of ecdysis are discussed by Braun, “Ueber
die histologischen Vorgänge bei der Häutung von <i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>.”
Würzburg Arbeiten, Bd. II.</p>

<span class="h3lg">
REPRODUCTION IN CRAYFISHES.</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">The males are said to approach the females in November, December,
and January, in the case of the French crayfishes. In England they
certainly begin as early as the beginning of October, if not earlier.
According to M. Chantran (Comptes Rendus, 1870), and M. Gerbe
(Comptes Rendus, 1858), the male seizes the female with his pincers,
throws her on her back, and deposits the spermatic matter, firstly, on the
external plates of the caudal fin; secondly, on the thoracic sterna around
the external openings of the oviducts. During this operation, the
appendages of the two first abdominal somites
are carried backwards, <span class="xxpn" id="p351">{351}</span>
the extremities of the posterior pair are inclosed in the groove of the
anterior pair; and the end of the vas deferens becoming everted and
prominent, the seminal matter is poured out, and runs slowly along the
groove of the anterior appendage to its destination, where it hardens and
assumes a vermicular aspect. The filaments of which it is composed are,
in fact, tubular spermatophores, and consist of a tough case or sheath
filled with seminal matter. The spoon-shaped extremity of the second
abdominal appendage, working backwards and forwards in the groove
of the anterior appendage, clears the seminal matter out of it, and
prevents it from becoming choked.</p>

<p>After an interval which varies from ten to forty-five days, oviposition
takes place. The female, resting on her back, bends the end of the
abdomen forward over the hinder thoracic sterna, so that a chamber is
formed into which the oviducts open. The eggs are passed into the
chamber by one operation, usually during the night, and are plunged
into a viscous greyish mucus with which it is filled. The spermatozoa
pass out of the vermicular spermatophores, and mix with this fluid, in
which the peculiarity of their form renders them readily recognisable.
The spermatozoa are thus brought into close relation with the ova, but
what actually becomes of them is unknown.</p>

<p>The origin of the viscous matter which fills the abdominal chamber
when the eggs are deposited in it, and the manner in which these become
fixed to the abdominal limbs is discussed by Lereboullet (“Recherches
sur le mode de fixation des œufs aux faux pattes abdominaux dans les
Écrevisses.” Annales des Sciences Naturelles, 4e Ee. T. XIV. 1860),
and by Braun (Arbeiten aus dem Zoologisch-Zootomischen Institut in
Würzburg, II.).</p>

<span class="h3lg">
ATTACHMENT OF THE YOUNG CRAYFISH TO THE MOTHER.</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">I observe that I had overlooked a passage in the Report on the
award of the Prix Montyon for 1872, Comptes Rendus, LXXV. p. 1341,
in which M. Chantran is stated to have ascertained that the young
crayfishes fix themselves “en saisissant avec un de leurs pinces le
filament qui suspend l’œuf à une fausse patte de la mère.”</p>

<p>In the paper already cited from the Comptes Rendus for 1870, M. Chantran
states that the young remain attached to the mother during ten days
after hatching, that is to say, up to the first moult. Detached before
this period, they die; but after the first moult, they
sometimes leave the <span class="xxpn" id="p352">{352}</span>
mother and return to her again, up to twenty-eight days, when they
become independent.</p>

<p>In a note appended to M. Chantran’s paper, M. Robin states, that “the
young are suspended to the abdomen of the mother by the intermediation
of a chitinous hyaline filament, which extends from a point of the
internal surface of the shell of the egg as far as the four most internal
filaments of each of the lobes of the median membranous plate
of the caudal appendage. The filaments exist when the embryos have
not yet attained three-fourths of their development.” Is this a larval
coat? Rathke does not mention it and I have seen nothing of it in
those recently hatched young which I have had the opportunity of
examining.</p>

THE “SALIVARY” GLANDS AND THE SO-CALLED “LIVER” OF
THE CRAYFISH.</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">Braun (Arbeiten aus dem Zoologisch-Zootomischen Institut in
Würzburg, Bd. II. and III.) has described “salivary” glands in the
walls of the œsophagus, in the metastoma, and in the first pair of maxillæ
of the crayfish.</p>

<p>Hoppe-Seyler (Pflügers Archiv, Bd. XIV. 1877) finds that the yellow
fluid ordinarily found in the stomachs of crayfishes always contains peptone.
It dissolves fibrin readily, without swelling it up, at ordinary temperatures;
more quickly at 40° Centigrade. The action is delayed by even
a trace of hydrochloric acid, and is stopped by the addition of a few drops
of water containing 0.2 per cent. of that acid. By adding alcohol to the
yellow fluid, a precipitate is obtained, which is soluble in water and in
glycerine. The aqueous solution of the precipitate has a strong digestive
action on fibrin, which is arrested by acidulation with hydrochloric acid.
These reactions show that the fluid is very similar to, if not identical
with, the pancreatic fluid of vertebrates.</p>

<p>The secretion of the “liver” taken directly from that gland, has a
more strongly acid reaction than the fluid in the stomach, but has
similar digestive properties. So has an aqueous extract of the gland,
and a watery solution of the alcoholic precipitate. The aqueous extract
also possesses a strong diastatic action on starch, and breaks up olive oil.
There is no more glycogen in the “liver” than is to be found in other
organs, and no constituents of true bile are to
be met with.</p>

ANAL RESPIRATION IN CRAYFISH.</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">Lereboullet (“Note sur une respiration anale observée chez plusieurs
Crustacés;” Mémoires de la Société d’Histoire Naturelle de Strasbourg,
IV. 1850) has drawn attention to what he terms “anal respiration” in
young crayfish, in which he observed water to be alternately taken into
and expelled from the rectum fifteen to seventeen times in a minute.
I have never been able to observe anything of this kind in the uninjured
adult animal, but if the thoracic ganglia are destroyed, a regular
rhythmical dilatation and closing of the anal end of the rectum at once
sets in, and goes on as long as the hindermost ganglia of the abdomen
retain their integrity. I am much disposed to imagine that the rhythmical
movement is inhibited, when the uninjured crayfish is held in such
a position that the vent can be examined.</p>

THE GREEN GLAND.</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">The existence of guanin in the green gland rests on the authority
of Will and Gorup-Besanez (Gelehrte Anzeigen, d. k. Baienzschen
Akademie, No. 233, 1848), who say that in this organ and in the organ of
Bojanus of the freshwater mussel, they found “a substance the reactions
of which with the greatest probability indicate guanin,” but that they
had been unable to obtain sufficient material to give decisive results.</p>

<p>Leydig (Lehrbuch der Histologie, p. 467) long
ago stated that the green gland consists of a much
convoluted tube containing granular cells disposed
around a central cavity. Wassiliew (“Ueber die Niere
des Flusskrebses:” Zoologischer Anzeiger, I. 1878)
supports the same view, giving a full account of the
minute structure of the organ, and comparing it with
its homologues in the <i>Copepoda</i> and <i>Phyllopoda</i>.</p>

given an account of a number of interesting and important experiments
on this subject.</p>

THE THEORY OF MOSAIC VISION.</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">Oscar Schmidt (“Die Form der Krystalkegel im
Arthropoden Auge:” Zeitschrift für Wissenschaftliche
Zoologie, XXX. 1878) has pointed out certain
difficulties in the way of the universal
application of the theory of mosaic vision in
its present form, which are well worthy of
consideration. I do not think, however, that the
substance of the theory is affected by Schmidt’s
objections.</p>

<span class="h3lg">
THE SPERMATOZOA.</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">Since the discovery of the spermatozoa of the crayfish in 1835–36 by
Henle and von Siebold. the structure and development of these bodies
have been repeatedly studied. The latest discussion of the subject is
contained in a memoir of Dr. C. Grobben (“Beiträge zur Kenntniss der
männlichen Geschlechtsorgane der Dekapoden:” Wien, 1878). There
is no doubt that the spermatozoon consists of a flattened or hemispherical
body, produced at its circumference into a greater or less
number of long tapering curved processes (fig.
<a href="#f34" title="go to &#x66;ig. 34">34</a> F). In the interior
of this are two structures, one of which occupies the greater part
of the body, and, when the latter lies flat, looks like a double ring.
This may be called, for distinctness’ sake, the <i>annulate corpuscle</i>. The
other is a much smaller <i>oval corpuscle</i>, which lies on one side of the
first. The annulate corpuscle is dense, and strongly refracting; the oval
corpuscle is soft, and less sharply defined. Dr. Grobben describes the
annulate corpuscle as “napfartig,” or cup-shaped; closed below, open
above, and with the upper edge turned inwards, and applied to the
inner side of the wall of the cup. It appeared to me, on the other
hand, that the annulate corpuscle is really a
hollow ring, somewhat <span class="xxpn" id="p355">{355}</span>
like one of the ring-shaped air-cushions one sees, on a
very small scale. Dr. Grobben describes the spermatoblastic
cells of the testis and their nuclear spindles; but his
account of the development of the spermatozoa does not
agree with my own observations, which, so far as they have
gone, lead me to infer that the annulate corpuscle of the
spermatozoon is the metamorphosed nucleus of the cell from
which the spermatozoon is developed. For want of material,
however, I was unable to bring my investigations to a
satisfactory termination, and I speak with reserve.</p>

<span class="h3lg">
THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE CRAYFISH.</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">The founder of the morphology of the
<i>Crustacea</i>, M. Milne Edwards, counts the telson as
a somite, and consequently considers that twenty-one
somites enter into the composition of the body in the
<i>Podophthalmia</i>. Moreover, he assigns the anterior
seven somites to the head, the middle seven to the
thorax, and the hinder seven to the abdomen. There is
a tempting aspect of symmetry about this arrangement;
but as to the limits of the head, the natural line
of demarcation between it and the thorax seems to me
to be so clearly indicated between the somite which
bears the second maxillæ and that which carries the
first maxillipedes in the <i>Crustacea</i>, and between
the homologous somites in Insects, that I have no
hesitation in retaining the grouping which I have for
many years adopted. The exact nature of the telson
needs to be elucidated, but I can find no ground for
regarding it as the homologue of a single somite.</p>

<p>It will be observed that these differences of opinion turn upon questions
of grouping and nomenclature. It would make no difference to
the general argument if it were admitted that the whole body consists
of twenty-one somites and the head of seven.</p>

<span class="h3lg">
THE HISTOLOGY OF THE CRAYFISH.</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">In dealing with the histology of the
crayfish I have been obliged to content myself with
stating the facts as they appear to me. The discussion
of the interpretations put upon these facts by other
observers, especially in the case of those tissues,
such as muscle, on which there is as yet no complete
agreement even as to matters of observation, would
require a whole treatise to itself.</p>

<span class="h3lg">
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CRAYFISH.</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">The remark made in the last note applies still more strongly to the
history of the development of the crayfish. Notwithstanding the masterly
memoir of Rathke, which constitutes the foundation of all our
knowledge on this subject; the subsequent investigations of Lereboullet;
and the still more recent careful and exhaustive works of Reichenbach
and Bobretsky, a great many points require further investigation. In
all its most important features I have reason to believe that the account
of the process of development given in the text, is correct.</p>

<span class="h3lg">
PARASITES OF CRAYFISHES.</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">In France and Germany crayfishes
(apparently, however, only <i>A. nobilis</i>) are
infested by parasites, belonging to the genus
<i>Branchiobdella</i>. These are minute, flattened,
vermiform animals, somewhat like small leeches, from
one-half to one-third of an inch in length, which
attach themselves to the under side of the abdomen
(<i>B. parasitica</i>), or to the gills (<i>B. astaci</i>), and
live on the blood and on the eggs of the crayfish. A
full account of this parasite, with reference to the
literature of the subject, is given by Dormer (“Ueber
die Gattung Branchiobdella:” Zeitschrift für Wiss.
Zoologie, XV. 1865). According to Gay, a similar
parasite is found on the Chilian crayfish. I have
never met with it on the English crayfish. The Lobster
has a somewhat similar parasite, <i>Histriobdella</i>.
Girard, in the paper cited in the Bibliography, gives
a curious account of the manner in which the little
lamellibranchiate mollusk, <i>Cyclas fontinalis</i>, shuts
the ends of the ambulatory limbs of crayfishes which
inhabit the same waters, between its valves, so
that the crayfish resembles a cat in walnut shells,
and the pinched ends of the limbs become eroded and
mutilated.</p></div><!--section-->

TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

<p class="pfirst">Original spelling and grammar have been generally retained, with
some exceptions noted below.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Ditto marks have been removed. In the <i>List of Woodcuts</i>, the ditto
marks have been replaced with em dashes.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Footnotes have been relabeled 1–43 and moved from within paragraphs
to nearby locations between paragraphs.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Illustrations have been moved from within paragraphs to nearby
locations between paragraphs. Therefore, the page numbers
shown in the List of Woodcuts are sometimes wrong.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Original printed page numbers are shown in the right margin like
this: {52}.</p>

<p class="pfirst">I produced the cover image and hereby assign it to the public domain.</p>

<p>On page <a href="#p176" title="go to &#x70;.
176">176</a> and elsewhere there are phrases such
as ‹rarely exceed 1‐700th›, in which the fraction
appears to have been printed with a hyphen. In other
places, e.g. page <a href="#p019" title="go to &#x70;.
19">19</a>, there are fractions such as ‹1/110th›,
in which the ‹1› was printed over a vinculum, over
‹110›, in small text, and this fraction was followed
by ‹th› in regular sized text. Herein, both forms
have been converted to a form like this: ‹1‐30,000th›,
using the Unicode character [u+2010 hyphen].</p>

<ul class="padtopb">
<li class="lihanga">Page <a href="#p000-xi" title="go to &#x70;. xi">xi</a>.
The <span class="smmaj">LIST OF WOODCUTS</span> was
restructured slightly to form a simple list. Ditto
marks and curly brackets were removed.</li>

<li class="lihanga">Page
<a href="#p074" title="go to &#x70;. 74">74</a>.
The phrase ‹that it to
say› was changed to ‹that is to say›.</li>

<li class="lihanga">Page <a href="#p102" title="go to
&#x70;. 102">102</a>. The phrase ‹fibre fig. 19, F.)›
was changed to ‹fibre (fig. 19, F).›.</li>

The word
‹develope› was changed to ‹develop›.</li>

The name ‹M’Intosh› appears on page 288, but this name is spelled
in the Index on page 368 with what would now be represented by the
Unicode character [ʻ U+02bb; <span class="smmaj">MODIFIER LETTER
TURNED COMMA</span>] in place of the right single quotation mark.
U+02bb is probably correct, but several current browsers don’t
support this character. So both instances are spelled herein ‹M<sup
class="supsm">c</sup>Intosh›.</li>

<li class="lihanga">Page <a href="#p298" title="go to

&#x70;. 345">345</a>. The graphic chart, <i>Successive
Forms of the Astacomorphous Type</i>, is poorly
represented in our text edition, due to the inherent
limitations of plain text. An image is used in the
html edition.</li>

<li class="lihanga">Page <a href="#p363" title="go
to &#x70;. 363">363</a>. The original <span
class="smmaj">INDEX</span> was structured loosely
as a nested list. In the simple text edition, this
structure has been reproduced as well as possible.
In the html/epub/mobi editions, an html nested list
structure has been imposed. Html list code is more
rigidly semantic than the original printed index, so
some corrections had to be applied, and ambiguities
were necessarily clarified. A few mistakes are possible
during such a process.</li></ul>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
